## 3. Common SIEM/SOAR Workflows

### Windows Authentication Monitoring
**Event ID 4625 (Failed Logons)**:
```
Detection Logic:
- Monitor for >5 failures per source IP in 5 minutes
- Alert on >10 failures from external IPs
- Track unique account targeting patterns

Response Actions:
- Block source IP at firewall
- Lock targeted accounts temporarily
- Alert security team and account owners
- Investigate for successful authentications
```

**Event ID 4624 (Successful Logons)**:
```
Detection Logic:
- Unusual logon times or locations
- Service account interactive logons
- Privileged account usage patterns
- Logon type anomalies

Response Actions:
- Verify legitimacy with account owner
- Check for concurrent suspicious activities
- Monitor for lateral movement indicators
- Document in case management system
```

### PowerShell Monitoring
**Suspicious PowerShell Indicators**:
- EncodedCommand usage
- DownloadString functions
- Base64 encoded payloads
- PowerShell execution policy bypasses
- Invoke-Expression patterns

**Detection Query Example**:
```spl
index=security sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
| search EventCode=4104 OR EventCode=4103
| regex Message="(?i)(encodedcommand|downloadstring|invoke-expression)"
| stats count by Computer, User, Message
| where count > 1
```

### Lateral Movement Detection
**Key Indicators**:
- Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned)
- Event ID 4648 (Logon with explicit credentials)
- Unusual admin account usage
- Cross-network authentication patterns

**Detection Strategy**:
```spl
index=security (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4648)
| eval src_category=case(
    cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src_ip), "internal",
    cidrmatch("192.168.0.0/16", src_ip), "internal",
    1=1, "external")
| where src_category="internal"
| stats dc(dest_host) as unique_hosts by user, src_ip
| where unique_hosts > 5
```

### Phishing Response Workflow
**Automated Phishing Triage**:
1. Extract email metadata and attachments
2. Analyze URLs and domains
3. Check threat intelligence feeds
4. Scan attachments for malware
5. Assess user interaction (clicked/downloaded)
6. Determine response actions

**Response Actions**:
- Quarantine suspicious emails
- Block malicious URLs/domains
- Reset user credentials if compromised
- Isolate affected endpoints
- Notify security awareness team

## 7. Interview Sound Bites and Talking Points

### Professional Responses
**On Alert Triage**: 
"My approach to alerts is always triage first â€” severity, scope, and potential impact. I use a risk-based prioritization framework that considers business context and threat landscape."

**On False Positives**: 
"Reducing false positives is key. Otherwise analysts drown in noise. I focus on tuning detection logic, improving data quality, and implementing behavioral baselines."

**On MITRE ATT&CK**: 
"Every detection I write, I map to MITRE ATT&CK to ensure coverage. This helps with threat hunting prioritization and communicating risk to leadership."

**On Automation**: 
"I see SOAR as the force multiplier â€” humans decide, automation executes. The key is designing playbooks that enhance analyst capabilities rather than replace human judgment."

### Technical Depth Examples
**Splunk Detection Query**:
```spl
index=security sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
| bucket _time span=5m
| stats count as failure_count, dc(Account_Name) as unique_accounts by src_ip, _time
| where failure_count > 5 AND unique_accounts > 1
| eval risk_score = failure_count * unique_accounts
| where risk_score > 25
```

**LimaCharlie D&R Rule**:
```yaml
detect:
  event: NEW_PROCESS
  op: and
  rules:
    - op: contains
      path: event/COMMAND_LINE
      value: "-EncodedCommand"
    - op: contains
      path: event/COMMAND_LINE
      value: "powershell"
respond:
  - action: report
    name: suspicious_powershell_encoded
  - action: isolation
    duration: 3600
```
