# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** provides a structure for managing cybersecurity risk across five core functions. Updated to version 2.0 in 2024, it offers a risk-based approach aligned to business outcomes.

## Five Core Functions

### 1. IDENTIFY (ID)
Understand your cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.

**Key Activities:**
- Asset management and inventory
- Business environment assessment  
- Risk assessment and governance
- Supply chain risk management

**Example Controls:**
- Maintain hardware/software asset inventories
- Classify data based on sensitivity levels
- Establish cybersecurity roles and responsibilities

### 2. PROTECT (PR)  
Implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.

**Key Activities:**
- Identity management and access control
- Awareness and training programs
- Data security and protective technology
- Information protection processes

**Example Controls:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Regular security awareness training
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Vulnerability management program

### 3. DETECT (DE)
Implement appropriate activities to identify cybersecurity events.

**Key Activities:**
- Continuous security monitoring
- Detection processes and procedures  
- Anomaly and event analysis
- Security continuous monitoring

**Example Controls:**
- SIEM/SOAR platform deployment
- Network and endpoint monitoring
- Threat intelligence integration
- Regular security testing

### 4. RESPOND (RS)
Implement appropriate activities to take action on detected cybersecurity incidents.

**Key Activities:**
- Response planning and procedures
- Communications and coordination
- Analysis and mitigation activities
- Improvements based on lessons learned

**Example Controls:**
- Incident response team and playbooks
- Stakeholder communication plans
- Forensic analysis capabilities
- Post-incident review process

### 5. RECOVER (RC)
Implement appropriate activities to maintain resilience and restore services impaired by cybersecurity incidents.

**Key Activities:**
- Recovery planning and implementation
- Improvements and communications
- Business continuity planning
- Coordination with internal/external parties

**Example Controls:**
- Business continuity/disaster recovery plans
- System backup and restoration procedures
- Crisis communication protocols
- Recovery time/point objectives (RTO/RPO)

## Implementation Tiers

**Tier 1 - Partial**: Ad hoc, reactive approach
**Tier 2 - Risk Informed**: Risk management practices approved but not organization-wide  
**Tier 3 - Repeatable**: Organization-wide practices with regular updates
**Tier 4 - Adaptive**: Advanced, predictive approach with continuous improvement

## Your Implementation

**Current Status**: NIST CSF 2.0 compliance program with quarterly assessments and continuous monitoring across all five functions. Target maturity level: Tier 3 (Repeatable) by Q4 2024.
