Please provide a incident response playbook for SQL Injection and Command Injection? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : SQL Injection and Command Injection Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
Identify Critical Applications:
Documentation: Maintain an inventory of all OT applications, databases, web interfaces, and APIs. This should include details about the technology stack, versions, configurations, and any custom-developed components.
Prioritization: Assign criticality levels to each application based on their role in OT operations. Focus on those that have direct control over industrial processes or sensitive data.
Security Assessments:
Regular Vulnerability Scans: Schedule and conduct vulnerability scans using tools like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, or Burp Suite to identify potential SQL and command injection points.
Code Reviews: Perform code reviews focusing on input validation and output encoding. Use automated tools like SonarQube combined with manual reviews by experienced developers.
Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process. Regularly update software, databases, and dependencies to the latest secure versions.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Form a team with roles including an incident commander, network security specialist, database administrator, application security expert, and communication officer.
Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define and document roles. Ensure all team members understand their responsibilities during an incident.
Training:
Regular Training: Conduct regular training sessions, including workshops on identifying injection attacks and hands-on response exercises.
Secure Coding Practices: Train developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing input validation, parameterized queries, and least privilege principles.
Tools:
Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Deploy WAFs to detect and block SQL and command injection attempts. Configure them to alert and block based on signatures and behavioral analysis.
Database Activity Monitoring (DAM): Use DAM tools to monitor database activities and set up alerts for unusual queries or patterns.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Deploy IDS to monitor network traffic for signs of injection attacks.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Anomaly Detection:
Behavioral Analytics: Implement tools that use machine learning to detect deviations from normal database and application usage patterns.
Threshold Alerts: Set thresholds for normal database query volumes and execution times. Alerts should trigger for abnormal activity, such as a sudden increase in the number of queries.
Log Monitoring:
Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor logs from applications, databases, web servers, and network devices.
Log Analysis: Use tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate and analyze logs. Look for patterns indicating SQL or command injection attempts, such as repeated use of keywords like SELECT, DROP, INSERT, or command shell execution.
Real-Time Alerts:
SIEM Integration: Integrate all logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Configure real-time alerts for detected anomalies or suspicious activities.
Alert Prioritization: Ensure alerts are prioritized based on their potential impact on critical OT operations. High-severity alerts should trigger immediate investigation.
Incident Categorization:
Attack Identification: Use log data, WAF alerts, and database activity reports to identify the type of injection attack. SQL injection often shows up as malformed SQL queries, while command injection involves unauthorized shell commands.
Scope Determination: Determine the scope by identifying affected applications, databases, and endpoints. Use network flow data to map the extent of the attack.
Impact Assessment:
Operational Impact: Assess the immediate impact on OT operations, including system downtime, data integrity, and the potential for unauthorized command execution.
Resource Utilization: Check resource utilization metrics for affected systems to determine if the attack is causing performance issues or service degradation.
Source Identification:
IP Tracking: Track the IP addresses associated with suspicious activity. Use geolocation tools to identify their origin and cross-reference with known threat intelligence databases.
Payload Analysis: Analyze the injected queries or commands to understand the attacker's intent and the potential damage.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the Attack’s Effects on the Targeted Environment

Traffic Filtering:
WAF Rules: Update WAF rules to block the identified injection patterns. Use virtual patching to mitigate vulnerabilities until a proper fix can be deployed.
IP Blacklisting: Blacklist IP addresses involved in the attack at the firewall level. Ensure this does not disrupt legitimate traffic.
Rate Limiting:
Traffic Throttling: Implement rate limiting on critical endpoints to slow down potential attackers and reduce the impact of automated attacks.
Adaptive Rate Limiting: Use adaptive rate limiting to dynamically adjust based on real-time traffic analysis, ensuring legitimate operations are not hindered.
Access Control:
Restrict Access: Temporarily restrict access to affected systems and endpoints. Implement emergency access controls and revoke unnecessary privileges.
Enhanced Authentication: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing critical applications and systems.
4. Eradication: : Mitigation Tools:
Database Security Tools: Use tools to scan for and fix SQL injection vulnerabilities. Ensure databases are configured securely with minimal permissions.
Command Execution Controls: Implement controls to restrict unauthorized command execution, such as using sudo restrictions and limiting shell access.
Patch and Update:
Vulnerability Patching: Apply patches and updates to fix identified vulnerabilities. Ensure that application frameworks, libraries, and dependencies are also updated.
Security Updates: Regularly apply security updates to all systems involved, including databases, application servers, and network devices.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations
System Checks:
Integrity Verification: Perform comprehensive checks to ensure all systems and applications are functioning correctly and are free of malicious activity. Verify that database schemas and data have not been tampered with.
Health Monitoring: Monitor system health using performance and security metrics to ensure stability.
Traffic Normalization:
Gradual Restoration: Gradually restore normal traffic flow while monitoring for any residual malicious activity. Implement phased recovery to ensure stability.
Baseline Comparison: Continuously compare current traffic patterns with established baselines to detect any anomalies.
Data Integrity:
Data Verification: Verify the integrity of application data and configurations. Conduct database audits to check for unauthorized changes.
Backup Restoration: If any data corruption or loss is detected, restore data from secure backups. Ensure backups are recent and not compromised.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
Documentation:
Incident Report: Create a detailed incident report covering the type of attack, detection methods, response actions, timeline, and impact assessment. Include a summary of what was learned.
Lessons Learned: Document lessons learned, focusing on the root causes and gaps in the response process.
Review and Improve:
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident with the IRT and relevant stakeholders. Analyze the effectiveness of the response and identify areas for improvement.
Plan Updates: Update the IR plan based on findings and recommendations. Ensure the plan incorporates the latest best practices and threat intelligence.
Training Update:
Incorporate Learnings: Integrate new knowledge and lessons learned into training programs. Ensure all relevant personnel are aware of the updates.
Ongoing Training: Schedule regular training and awareness sessions. Use updated scenarios from the incident to enhance future preparedness.</s>
