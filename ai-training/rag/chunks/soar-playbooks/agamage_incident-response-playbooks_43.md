Please provide incident response playbook for Application Layer DDoS Attack? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : NIST compliant Incident Response Framework Playbook for Application Layer DDoS Attack
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
Identify Critical Applications:
Documentation: Create a comprehensive list of all OT applications, including web interfaces, APIs, SCADA software, HMI, and other monitoring and control systems. Use asset management tools to keep the list updated.
Prioritization: Rank these applications based on their criticality to operations, using a scoring system that considers factors like dependency, impact on operations, and downtime tolerance.
Security Assessments:
Regular Assessments: Schedule and perform regular security assessments, including vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and code reviews.
Third-Party Audits: Engage third-party security firms to conduct periodic audits for unbiased assessments.
Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security updates.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Assemble a dedicated team with members from IT, OT, and cybersecurity departments. Include roles such as incident commander, application security experts, and communication leads.
Roles and Responsibilities: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member, ensuring redundancy in critical roles.
Training:
Regular Training: Conduct regular training sessions on identifying and responding to application layer attacks. Use tabletop exercises and simulation drills.
Awareness Programs: Develop awareness programs to educate staff on common attack vectors, social engineering tactics, and safe practices.
Tools:
Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Deploy WAFs to protect web applications from common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and HTTP floods.
Application Monitoring Tools: Use tools to monitor application performance, user behavior, and transaction anomalies.
SIEM Integration: Ensure all application logs are integrated with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the Incident, Determine its Scope, and Involve the Appropriate Parties
Anomaly Detection:
Behavioral Analytics: Use tools that employ behavioral analytics to detect deviations from normal application usage patterns.
Threshold Alerts: Configure alerts for unusual activity such as a high number of HTTP requests, failed login attempts, or abnormal API calls.
Log Monitoring:
Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring of application logs, focusing on error logs, access logs, and security logs.
Automated Analysis: Use automated log analysis tools to correlate events and identify potential threats.
Real-Time Alerts:
SIEM Configuration: Set up real-time alerts in the SIEM system for suspicious application activity. Ensure alerts are prioritized based on the severity and criticality of the affected application.
Notification Channels: Establish multiple notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, dashboard alerts) to ensure prompt awareness and response.
Incident Categorization:
Attack Identification: Determine the type of attack (e.g., HTTP flood, Slowloris, SQL injection) by analyzing the symptoms and attack patterns.
Scope Determination: Assess the extent of the attack, including affected applications, endpoints, and user accounts.
Impact Assessment:
Operational Impact: Evaluate the impact on OT operations, including potential downtime, data integrity issues, and safety risks.
Resource Utilization: Assess the impact on system resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage.
Source Identification:
IP Tracking: Identify the IP addresses involved in the attack. Use geolocation tools to determine the geographical origin of the IPs.
User Agent Analysis: Analyze user agents to identify potentially malicious traffic sources.
3. Containment: : Rate Limiting:
Traffic Throttling: Implement rate limiting for incoming requests to critical applications to mitigate the impact of an attack.
Dynamic Controls: Use dynamic rate limiting that adjusts based on current traffic patterns and threat levels.
Access Control:
Restrict Access: Temporarily restrict access to affected applications and endpoints to prevent further damage.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for accessing critical applications and systems.
WAF Rules:
Custom Rules: Apply specific WAF rules to filter out malicious traffic based on the attack patterns identified.
Rule Tuning: Continuously tune WAF rules to adapt to evolving attack strategies.
4. Eradication: : Mitigation Tools:
DDoS Mitigation Services: Use DDoS mitigation services to filter out and block malicious traffic.
Advanced Firewalls: Employ advanced firewalls with application-layer filtering capabilities.
Block IPs/User Agents:
IP Blacklisting: Block IP addresses identified as sources of the attack at the firewall or WAF level.
User Agent Blocking: Block suspicious user agents identified during the analysis phase.
Patch and Update:
Vulnerability Patching: Apply patches and updates to affected applications to close vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
Security Updates: Ensure all security updates are applied to underlying systems, libraries, and dependencies.
5. Recovery: : System Checks:
Integrity Verification: Perform thorough checks to ensure all applications are functioning correctly and are free of malicious activity.
Health Monitoring: Monitor the health of applications using performance and security metrics.
Traffic Normalization:
Gradual Restoration: Gradually restore normal traffic flow while closely monitoring for any residual malicious activity.
Baseline Comparison: Compare current traffic patterns with established baselines to detect anomalies.
Data Integrity:
Data Verification: Verify the integrity of application data and configurations to ensure no tampering occurred.
Backup Restoration: Restore data from secure backups if any corruption or loss is detected.
6. Lessons Learned: : Documentation:
Incident Report: Document the incident in detail, including the type of attack, detection methods, response actions, timeline, and impact assessment.
Lessons Learned: Record lessons learned and any gaps identified in the response process.
Review and Improve:
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a thorough review of the incident with the IRT and other stakeholders. Discuss what went well and what could be improved.
Plan Updates: Update the IR plan based on findings and recommendations from the review.
Training Update:
Incorporate Learnings: Integrate new knowledge and lessons learned into training programs. Ensure all relevant personnel are aware of the updates.
Ongoing Training: Schedule regular training and awareness sessions to keep the team prepared for future incidents.</s>
