Please provide incident response playbook for Volume-Based DDoS Attack ? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : NIST compliant Incident Response Framework Playbook for Volume-Based DDoS Attack
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
Identify Critical Network Paths:
Documentation: Create a detailed map of network infrastructure, highlighting critical network paths, routers, switches, firewalls, and bandwidth resources. Use network management tools to keep this documentation updated.
Prioritization: Assign priorities to network paths based on their importance to OT operations, considering factors like data flow, control signals, and interdependencies.
Establish Baselines:
Traffic Monitoring: Implement continuous network traffic monitoring to establish baselines for normal traffic volumes, patterns, and behavior using tools like NetFlow or sFlow.
Historical Analysis: Use historical data to understand seasonal or operational traffic variations and establish what constitutes normal traffic for different times of the day or operational conditions.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Assemble a dedicated IRT with members from network security, IT, OT, and operations departments. Include roles such as incident commander, network engineers, and communication leads.
Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define roles and responsibilities, ensuring that all team members understand their duties during an incident. Establish a communication plan for internal and external stakeholders.
Training:
Regular Training: Conduct regular training sessions focused on recognizing and responding to volume-based attacks. Use simulation drills and tabletop exercises to enhance preparedness.
Cross-Training: Ensure that team members are cross-trained in both IT and OT aspects of network security to handle incidents more effectively.
Tools:
Network Monitoring Tools: Deploy advanced network monitoring tools that provide real-time visibility into traffic patterns and volumes.
DDoS Protection Services: Subscribe to DDoS protection services from ISPs or third-party providers that offer scrubbing centers and mitigation capabilities.
Traffic Analysis Tools: Use traffic analysis tools to detect anomalies and provide insights into network performance and threats.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the Incident, Determine its Scope, and Involve the Appropriate Parties
Anomaly Detection:
Threshold-Based Alerts: Configure alerts for unusual traffic volumes, such as spikes in incoming or outgoing traffic that exceed established baselines.
Behavioral Analytics: Employ behavioral analytics to detect deviations from normal traffic patterns, using machine learning to improve accuracy over time.
Log Monitoring:
Continuous Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring and analysis of logs from network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, and IDS/IPS.
Log Correlation: Use log correlation tools to link related events and identify patterns indicative of a volume-based attack.
Real-Time Alerts:
SIEM Integration: Integrate logs from all network devices with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and real-time alerting.
Alert Prioritization: Configure SIEM to prioritize alerts based on the severity and potential impact on critical network paths, ensuring prompt response.
Incident Categorization:
Attack Identification: Determine the type of volume-based attack (e.g., UDP flood, ICMP flood) by analyzing the traffic characteristics and patterns.
Scope Determination: Assess the extent of the attack, including affected network segments, devices, and services.
Impact Assessment:
Operational Impact: Evaluate the impact on network bandwidth, latency, and the performance of critical OT systems.
Resource Utilization: Assess the utilization of network resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth during the attack.
Source Identification:
IP Tracking: Identify the IP addresses involved in the attack, using geolocation tools to determine the geographical origin of the traffic.
Botnet Detection: Analyze traffic patterns to identify potential use of botnets and their command and control servers.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the Attack’s Effects on the Targeted Environment
Traffic Filtering:
Edge Filtering: Implement traffic filtering at the network edge to drop packets identified as malicious based on IP addresses, protocols, or traffic patterns.
Geofencing: Apply geofencing rules to block traffic from regions known to be sources of attacks.
Rate Limiting:
Traffic Throttling: Apply rate limiting on network devices to control the flow of suspicious traffic and prevent overwhelming network resources.
Adaptive Rate Limiting: Use adaptive rate limiting techniques that dynamically adjust thresholds based on real-time traffic analysis.
Access Control:
Restrict Access: Temporarily restrict access to critical network paths and services to prevent further impact.
Segmentation: Isolate affected network segments to contain the spread of the attack and protect unaffected areas.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Remove the Threat and Prevent Recurrence

Mitigation Tools:
DDoS Protection Services: Use DDoS protection services to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the internal network. These services often include traffic scrubbing centers that clean incoming traffic.
Advanced Firewalls: Employ advanced firewalls with capabilities like deep packet inspection and behavior-based blocking to identify and block malicious traffic.
Block IPs:
IP Blacklisting: Block IP addresses identified as sources of the attack at the firewall or router level.
Reputation-Based Blocking: Use reputation-based services to block IPs known for malicious activity.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations
System Checks:
Network Health: Perform thorough checks to ensure all network paths are functioning correctly and are free of malicious activity.
Device Health: Verify the health of network devices, ensuring they are operating normally and have not been compromised.
Traffic Normalization:
Gradual Restoration: Gradually restore normal traffic flow while closely monitoring for any residual malicious activity.
Continuous Monitoring: Continue monitoring network traffic to detect any signs of lingering or new attacks.
Data Integrity:
Configuration Verification: Verify the integrity of network configurations and ensure they match pre-attack settings.
Backup Restoration: Restore network configurations from backups if any corruption or unauthorized changes are detected.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
Documentation:
Incident Report: Document the incident comprehensively, including the type of attack, detection methods, response actions, timeline, and impact assessment.
Lessons Learned: Record lessons learned and any gaps identified in the response process.
Review and Improve:
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a thorough review of the incident with the IRT and other stakeholders. Discuss what went well and areas for improvement.
Plan Updates: Update the IR plan based on findings and recommendations from the review.
Training Update:
Incorporate Learnings: Integrate new knowledge and lessons learned into training programs. Ensure all relevant personnel are aware of the updates.
Ongoing Training: Schedule regular training and awareness sessions to keep the team prepared for future incidents.</s>
