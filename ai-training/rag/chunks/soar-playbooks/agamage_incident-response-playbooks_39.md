Please provide a incident response playbook for phishing attack? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Phishing Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
1.1 Policies and Procedures
Develop and Document Policies: Create detailed policies and procedures for incident response, specifically for phishing attacks.
Employee Training: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees on recognizing phishing attempts and the importance of reporting suspicious emails.
Incident Reporting Mechanism: Establish clear channels for reporting suspected phishing attempts (e.g., a dedicated email address or an internal reporting tool).
Regular Updates: Regularly update all incident response documentation and ensure it is accessible to all relevant personnel.
1.2 Incident Response Team (IRT)
Define Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly outline the roles and responsibilities within the IRT, including first responders, analysts, and communication coordinators.
Access Control: Ensure the IRT has the necessary access to systems, logs, and tools to effectively respond to incidents.
Tool Inventory: Maintain an inventory of tools and technologies needed for incident response, such as email filtering solutions, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and forensic analysis tools.
1.3 Internal Communication
Regular Updates: Provide regular updates to all stakeholders throughout the incident response process.
1.4 External Communication
Customer Notification: Notify customers if their information was compromised. Provide guidance on steps they should take to protect themselves.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the Incident, determine its Scope, and Involve the Appropriate Parties
2.1 Incident Identification
Monitoring and Alerts: Implement monitoring systems to detect phishing attempts, such as email filters, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, and user behavior analytics.
Employee Reports: Encourage employees to report suspicious emails immediately. Provide clear instructions on how to report these incidents.
2.2 Incident Triage
Initial Assessment: Assess the reported incident to determine its validity and potential impact. Verify if the email is indeed a phishing attempt.
Priority Classification: Classify the incident based on its severity and potential impact. Prioritize incidents that may have led to compromised credentials or sensitive data exposure.
2.3 Evidence Gathering
Email Analysis: Preserve the phishing email, including headers, body, and any attachments. Use tools to analyze email headers and identify spoofing.
Log Collection: Gather logs from email servers, web servers, network devices, and endpoints to trace the origin and impact of the phishing attack.
User Interviews: Interview affected users to gather more information about their interaction with the phishing email.
2.4 Technical Analysis
Link and Attachment Analysis: Analyze links and attachments in a controlled environment (sandbox) to determine their malicious intent.
Malware Detection: Use anti-malware tools to detect and analyze any malware associated with the phishing attack.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the Attack’s Effects on the Targeted Environment
3.1 Short-term Containment
Isolate Affected Systems: Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
Block Malicious URLs and IPs: Update security tools to block known malicious URLs and IP addresses associated with the phishing attack.
Disable Compromised Accounts: Temporarily disable any accounts suspected of being compromised.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take Actions to Stop the Phishing Campaign
Remove Phishing Emails: Use email filtering tools to delete the phishing email from all mailboxes.
Scan and Clean Systems: Perform a thorough scan of affected systems to identify and remove any malware or unauthorized changes.
Patch Vulnerabilities: Identify and patch any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited during the phishing attack.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations
Restore Systems: Restore systems to their normal state using backups if necessary.
Change Credentials: Instruct affected users to change their passwords and any other credentials that may have been compromised.
Monitor for Recurrence: Implement heightened monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or follow-up attacks.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
6.1 Report and Documentation
Incident Report: Document all actions taken during the incident response, including detection, containment, eradication, and recovery efforts.
Timeline: Create a detailed timeline of events from the initial detection to the final recovery.
6.2 Lessons Learned
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a meeting with the incident response team and other stakeholders to review the incident and response efforts.
Identify Gaps: Identify any gaps in the response process and areas for improvement.
Update Procedures: Update incident response procedures and training materials based on lessons learned.
6.3 Reporting
Internal Reporting: Prepare a detailed report for internal stakeholders, including senior management.
External Reporting: If required, report the incident to regulatory bodies, partners, and affected customers.
6.4 Continuous Improvement
Phishing Simulations: Conduct regular phishing simulation exercises to test and improve employee awareness and incident response procedures.
Ongoing Training: Provide ongoing training to employees on recognizing phishing attempts and the importance of reporting them.
Regular Reviews: Regularly review and update incident response policies and procedures to ensure they remain effective and relevant.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate feedback from post-incident reviews into the incident response plan to continually improve response capabilities.</s>
