Please generate a Ransomware Incident Response Playbook? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Incident Response Playbook for Ransomware Infection (NIST Compliant)
1. Preparation: : Objective: To prepare for a potential ransomware attack by establishing an incident response plan and conducting initial assessments.


Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Develop an incident response plan that includes roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and procedures for reporting and responding to ransomware attacks.
2. Identify critical systems and data that need to be protected and prioritize their backup and recovery.
3. Conduct a baseline assessment of the current security posture to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.
4. Develop a list of trusted sources for threat intelligence and stay informed about the latest ransomware trends and tactics.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: To quickly identify and analyze a ransomware attack to determine its scope and impact.

Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Implement monitoring tools to detect and alert on suspicious activity, such as unusual network traffic or file access.
2. Conduct regular system scans to identify any unauthorized access or changes to systems and data.
3. Establish a process for reporting and triaging incidents, including escalation procedures for critical incidents.
4. Use incident response kits and checklists to guide analysts through the analysis process.
5. Utilize threat intelligence feeds to inform analysis and identify the source of the attack.
3. Containment: : Objective: To isolate and contain the ransomware attack to prevent further damage and limit the spread of the attack.

Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Identify the affected systems and networks and isolate them from the rest of the network to prevent the attack from spreading.
2. Implement a backup and recovery plan to restore affected systems and data.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of the attack to identify the initial entry point and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers.
4. Utilize incident response kits and checklists to guide analysts through the containment process.
5. Consider the use of a "ransomware kill switch" to disable the attack if possible.
4. Eradication: : Objective: To remove the ransomware from affected systems and networks.

Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Implement a comprehensive response plan to remove the ransomware from affected systems and networks.
2. Utilize anti-ransomware tools and software to remove the attack from affected systems.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of the attack to identify the TTPs used by the attackers and to improve the organization's defenses.
4. Consider the use of a "ransomware decryption tool" to restore encrypted data.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to eradicate the attack for future reference.
5. Recovery: : Objective: To restore affected systems and data to a known good state and to ensure business continuity.

Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Develop a comprehensive recovery plan that includes procedures for restoring systems and data, as well as business continuity measures.
2. Implement a backup and recovery plan to restore affected systems and data.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of the attack to identify the root cause and to improve the organization's defenses.
4. Consider the use of a "ransomware recovery tool" to restore encrypted data.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to recover affected systems and data for future reference.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: To document the incident and the response, and to identify areas for improvement in the incident response plan and the organization's overall security posture.

Step-by-Step Guidance:

1. Conduct a thorough post-incident review (PIR) to document the incident and the response.
2. Identify the root cause of the incident and the TTPs used by the attackers.
3. Document lessons learned and areas for improvement in the incident response plan and the organization's overall security posture.
4. Utilize the incident response plan to improve the organization's defenses and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
5. Share lessons learned with the organization and the broader security community to improve the overall security posture of the industry.</s>
