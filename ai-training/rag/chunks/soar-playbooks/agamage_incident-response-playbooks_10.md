Please provide incident response playbook for Protocol-Based DDoS Attack? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : NIST compliant Incident Response Framework Playbook for Protocol-Based Attacks DDoS Attack
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
Identify Critical Assets:
Documentation: Create an inventory of all OT assets, including hardware, software, and communication protocols. Focus on critical systems like SCADA, PLCs, and communication protocols such as Modbus and DNP3.
Prioritization: Rank assets based on their importance to operations and potential impact of a disruption.
Establish Baselines:
Traffic Monitoring: Continuously monitor network traffic to establish a baseline of normal activity.
Behavioral Analysis: Use network behavior analysis tools to understand typical communication patterns and data flows.
Develop Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Assemble a team with members from IT, OT, and security departments.
Roles and Responsibilities: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member, including incident commander, communication lead, technical lead, and recovery lead.
Training:
Regular Drills: Conduct regular training and simulation exercises for the IRT to recognize and respond to protocol-based attacks.
Knowledge Sharing: Keep the team updated with the latest threats, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies.
Tools:
Network Monitoring Tools: Deploy tools to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies.
IDS/IPS: Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems to detect and block malicious traffic.
Protocol Analyzers: Use protocol analyzers to scrutinize communication protocols for any unusual or malicious activity.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the Incident, Determine its Scope, and Involve the Appropriate Parties
Detection
Anomaly Detection:
Alerts Configuration: Set up alerts for unusual protocol activity, such as a high volume of SYN packets or unexpected protocol commands.
Thresholds: Define thresholds for normal traffic and trigger alerts when these thresholds are exceeded.
Log Monitoring:
Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor and analyze logs from network devices, firewalls, and IDS/IPS.
Log Analysis Tools: Use log analysis tools to correlate events and identify patterns indicative of an attack.
Real-Time Alerts:
SIEM Integration: Integrate Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources.
Alerting Mechanisms: Configure SIEM to send real-time alerts for suspicious protocol activity, ensuring rapid response.
Analysis
Incident Categorization:
Attack Type Identification: Determine the type of protocol-based attack (e.g., SYN flood, TCP connection flood) based on the detected anomalies.
Scope Determination: Assess the extent of the attack, including affected systems and potential entry points.
Impact Assessment:
Critical Systems Analysis: Evaluate the impact on critical OT systems and their operations.
Operational Disruption: Determine the level of operational disruption and potential downtime.
Source Identification:
IP Address Tracking: Identify the source IP addresses involved in the attack.
Geographical Analysis: Analyze the geographical origin of the attack to understand if it's targeted from a specific region.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the Attack’s Effects on the Targeted Environment
Network Segmentation:
Isolate Segments: Quickly isolate affected network segments to prevent the spread of the attack.
Secure Zones: Ensure critical systems are placed in secure network zones with strict access controls.
Rate Limiting:
Traffic Limiting: Implement rate limiting on network devices to control the flow of suspicious traffic.
Adaptive Controls: Use adaptive rate limiting to dynamically adjust based on the severity of the attack.
Access Control:
Restrict Access: Immediately restrict access to critical systems and communication protocols during an attack.
Authentication: Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for accessing critical assets.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Remove the Threat and Prevent Recurrence
Mitigation Tools:
DDoS Protection: Deploy DDoS protection tools and services to filter out malicious traffic.
Security Appliances: Utilize security appliances capable of deep packet inspection to identify and block malicious packets.
Block IPs:
IP Blacklisting: Block IP addresses identified as sources of the attack.
Geofencing: Implement geofencing to block traffic from regions identified as sources of attacks.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations
System Checks:
Integrity Verification: Ensure all systems are functioning correctly and are free of malicious activity.
Patch Vulnerabilities: Patch any identified vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
Traffic Normalization:
Gradual Restoration: Gradually restore normal traffic flow while closely monitoring for any residual malicious activity.
Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor network performance to detect any abnormalities.
Data Integrity:
Data Verification: Verify the integrity of data and system configurations to ensure no tampering occurred.
Backup Restoration: Restore data from backups if any corruption or loss is detected.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
Documentation:
Incident Report: Document the incident, including the type of attack, detection methods, response actions, and timeline.
Lessons Learned: Record lessons learned and any gaps identified in the response process.
Review and Improve:
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a thorough review of the incident and the effectiveness of the response.
Plan Updates: Update the IR plan based on findings and recommendations from the review.
Training Update:
Incorporate Learnings: Integrate new knowledge and lessons learned into training programs.
Ongoing Training: Ensure continuous training and awareness programs are in place to keep the team prepared.</s>
