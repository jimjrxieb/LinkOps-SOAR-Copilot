Please provide a incident response playbook for SQL Injection and Command Injection? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : SQL Injection and Command Injection Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish Contacts, Define Procedures, Gather Information to Save Time During an Incident
Identify Critical Applications:
Documentation: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all OT applications, web interfaces, and APIs that interact with databases or execute commands. Include details about the technology stack and configurations.
Prioritization: Assign criticality levels to these applications based on their role in operations and potential impact of an injection attack.
Security Assessments:
Regular Vulnerability Scans: Schedule regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests focusing on SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities.
Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure that input validation and output encoding are properly implemented.
Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security patches and updates.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Form a dedicated IRT with members from IT, OT, and cybersecurity departments. Include roles such as incident commander, database administrators, application security experts, and communication leads.
Roles and Responsibilities: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member, ensuring redundancy in critical roles.
Training:
Regular Training: Conduct regular training sessions on identifying and responding to SQL injection and command injection attacks. Use simulation drills and tabletop exercises.
Secure Coding Practices: Train developers and engineers on secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
Tools:
Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Deploy WAFs to protect web applications from SQL injection and command injection attacks.
Database Activity Monitoring (DAM): Use DAM tools to monitor and log database activities for anomalies.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Deploy IDS to detect malicious activities related to injection attacks.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Anomaly Detection:
Behavioral Analytics: Use behavioral analytics to detect deviations from normal application usage patterns, such as unusual database queries or command executions.
Threshold Alerts: Configure alerts for unusual activity like a high number of database queries or commands executed in a short time frame.
Log Monitoring:
Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor and analyze logs from applications, databases, and servers for signs of SQL injection and command injection attacks.
Log Correlation: Use log correlation tools to link related events and identify patterns indicative of an injection attack.
Real-Time Alerts:
SIEM Integration: Integrate logs from all relevant systems with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and real-time alerting.
Alert Prioritization: Configure SIEM to prioritize alerts based on the severity and potential impact on critical applications and systems.
Incident Categorization:
Attack Identification: Determine the type of injection attack (SQL injection or command injection) by analyzing the symptoms and attack patterns.
Scope Determination: Assess the extent of the attack, including affected applications, databases, and systems.
Impact Assessment:
Operational Impact: Evaluate the impact on OT operations, including potential data breaches, unauthorized command executions, and downtime.
Resource Utilization: Assess the utilization of system resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth during the attack.
Source Identification:
IP Tracking: Identify the IP addresses involved in the attack, using geolocation tools to determine the geographical origin of the traffic.
Payload Analysis: Analyze the injected SQL queries or commands to understand the attacker's intent and objectives.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the Attack’s Effects on the Targeted Environment
Traffic Filtering:
WAF Rules: Apply specific WAF rules to filter out malicious traffic based on the attack patterns identified.
IP Blacklisting: Block IP addresses identified as sources of the attack at the firewall or router level.
Rate Limiting:
Traffic Throttling: Apply rate limiting on network devices to control the flow of suspicious traffic and prevent overwhelming system resources.
Adaptive Controls: Use adaptive rate limiting that adjusts thresholds based on real-time traffic analysis.
Access Control:
Restrict Access: Temporarily restrict access to affected applications and endpoints to prevent further impact.
Enhanced Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other enhanced access controls for critical applications.
4. Eradication: : Mitigation Tools:
Database Security Tools: Use database security tools to scan and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring databases are configured securely.
Command Execution Controls: Implement controls to restrict the execution of potentially dangerous commands on servers.
Patch and Update:
Vulnerability Patching: Apply patches and updates to affected applications and systems to close vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
Security Updates: Ensure all security updates are applied to underlying systems, libraries, and dependencies.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations

System Checks:
Integrity Verification: Perform thorough checks to ensure all applications and systems are functioning correctly and are free of malicious activity.
Health Monitoring: Monitor the health of applications and databases using performance and security metrics.
Traffic Normalization:
Gradual Restoration: Gradually restore normal traffic flow while closely monitoring for any residual malicious activity.
Baseline Comparison: Compare current traffic patterns with established baselines to detect anomalies.
Data Integrity:
Data Verification: Verify the integrity of application data and configurations to ensure no tampering occurred.
Backup Restoration: Restore data from secure backups if any corruption or loss is detected.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
Documentation:
Incident Report: Document the incident comprehensively, including the type of attack, detection methods, response actions, timeline, and impact assessment.
Lessons Learned: Record lessons learned and any gaps identified in the response process.
Review and Improve:
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a thorough review of the incident with the IRT and other stakeholders. Discuss what went well and areas for improvement.
Plan Updates: Update the IR plan based on findings and recommendations from the review.
Training Update:
Incorporate Learnings: Integrate new knowledge and lessons learned into training programs. Ensure all relevant personnel are aware of the updates.
Ongoing Training: Schedule regular training and awareness sessions to keep the team prepared for future incidents.</s>
