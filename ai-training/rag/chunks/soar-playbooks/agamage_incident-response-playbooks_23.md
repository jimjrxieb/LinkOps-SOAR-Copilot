You are a highly advanced AI assistant in our company responsible for generating detailed incident response playbooks for various types of cyber attacks in OT environment.Please generate a comprehensive incident response playbook for given attacks, adhering to the NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2 guidelines for computer security incident handling.The playbook must adhere to the NIST incident response lifecycle stages - Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.Each step should describe and elaborate in detail with key practical information to follow in response to a incident
<</SYS>>

Please generate a playbook for following incident. It was reported that the safety systems of an unidentified power station, believed to be in Saudi Arabia, were compromised when the Triconex industrial safety technology made by Schneider Electric SE was targeted in what is believed to have been a state sponsored attack. The computer security company Symantec claimed that the malware, known as "Triton", exploited a vulnerability in computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. It can disable safety instrumented systems, which can then contribute to a plant disaster. [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : NIST Compliant Incident Response Playbook for Triton Malware Attack
1. Preparation: : Policy Development and Procedures:
Develop and maintain an incident response policy specific to industrial control systems (ICS) and safety instrumented systems (SIS).
Establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for responding to Triton malware attacks.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Form an incident response team trained in ICS and SIS environments.
Conduct regular training and exercises, including simulations of Triton-like attacks.
Tools and Resources:
Deploy and regularly update advanced monitoring and detection tools for ICS.
Ensure secure and up-to-date backups for critical SIS components.
Maintain an up-to-date contact list of internal stakeholders, ICS vendors, and external cybersecurity experts.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Initial Detection:
Continuously monitor for unusual activities in SIS and ICS networks using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) with Triton-specific signatures.
Encourage staff to report anomalies or system malfunctions immediately.
Incident Reporting:
Establish a clear process for reporting suspected Triton incidents.
Use a centralized system for tracking incidents and maintaining detailed logs.
Incident Classification:
Confirm the presence of Triton malware through initial triage and forensic analysis.
Classify the incident based on its impact and scope (e.g., targeted SIS vs. broader ICS impact).
Data Collection and Analysis:
Collect relevant data, including network traffic logs, SIS configurations, and system logs.
Conduct detailed malware analysis to understand its behavior and impact.
Identify all affected systems and components.
Documentation:
Document all findings, analysis steps, and timelines.
Record all communications and actions taken during the incident response.
3. Containment: : Immediate Actions:
Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of the malware.
Implement network segmentation to protect critical SIS components.
Block known malicious IP addresses and domains associated with Triton.
4. Eradication: : Short-Term Eradication
Malware Removal:
Use forensic tools to remove Triton malware from affected systems.
Apply updates and patches to all vulnerable systems to prevent re-exploitation.
Long-Term Eradication
System Hardening:
Conduct a thorough review and secure SIS and ICS configurations.
Implement additional security controls, such as application whitelisting and enhanced monitoring.
Collaborate with ICS vendors to apply firmware updates and security patches.
5. Recovery: : System Restoration:
Restore systems from clean backups, ensuring they are free from Triton malware.
Test and validate the integrity and functionality of SIS before resuming normal operations.
Change all compromised credentials and implement multifactor authentication (MFA).
6. Lessons Learned: : Post incident analysis:
Conduct a comprehensive post-mortem analysis of the incident.
Identify successes and areas for improvement in the response process.
Reporting:
Compile a detailed incident report for internal stakeholders and regulatory bodies.
Share findings with relevant external parties, including industry groups and cybersecurity agencies.
Update Policies and Procedures:
Revise the incident response playbook based on lessons learned.
Update training programs and conduct additional drills to reinforce new procedures.
Follow-Up:
Monitor systems for any signs of lingering malware activity.
Ensure all remediation actions have been completed and validated.</s>
