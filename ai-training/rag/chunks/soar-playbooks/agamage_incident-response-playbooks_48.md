You are a highly advanced AI assistant in our company responsible for generating detailed incident response playbooks for various types of cyber attacks in OT environment.Please generate a comprehensive incident response playbook for given attacks, adhering to the NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2 guidelines for computer security incident handling.The playbook must adhere to the NIST incident response lifecycle stages - Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.Each step should describe and elaborate in detail with key practical information to follow in response to a incident
<</SYS>>

Please generate an incident response playbook for ransomware infection? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Ransomware Incident Response Playbook
1. Preparation: : 1.1 Develop and Maintain Policies:
Ensure all relevant policies are documented and reviewed regularly.
Establish an incident response policy that includes ransomware.
1.2 Identify Critical Assets:
Maintain an updated inventory of critical systems and data.
Prioritize assets based on business impact analysis.
1.3 Conduct Training and Awareness:
Regularly train staff on ransomware threats and incident response procedures.
Conduct phishing simulations and other exercises to prepare users.
1.4 Establish Incident Response Team (IRT):
Define roles and responsibilities within the IRT.
Ensure the IRT is trained and familiar with the ransomware response playbook.
1.5 Deploy and Configure Tools:
Ensure tools for detection, analysis, containment, and eradication are in place and configured.
Regularly update antivirus, EDR, and backup solutions.
Establish communication protocols: Define how the incident response team will communicate with each other, as well as with stakeholders and the public.
2. Detection and Analysis: : 2.1 Initial Detection:
Monitor systems for signs of ransomware (e.g., unusual file encryption, ransom notes).
Use SIEM, EDR, and IDS/IPS for detection and alerting.
2.2 Triage and Notification:
Validate the incident and classify its severity.
Notify relevant stakeholders, including the IRT, management, and affected users.
2.3 Identify Ransomware Type:
Determine the type and variant of ransomware.
Analyze ransom notes, file extensions, and encrypted file properties.
Use tools like ID Ransomware and Crypto Sheriff for identification.
2.4 Scope the Impact:
Identify affected systems and data.
Determine the extent of the infection and potential spread.
Use network monitoring tools to identify C2 communications.
2.5 Find the infection vector:
Check tactics captured in the Initial Access tactic of MITRE ATT&CK.

2.6 Document Findings:
Keep detailed records of the incident, including indicators of compromise (IOCs) and system logs.
3. Containment: : 3.1 Immediate Containment:
Disconnect affected systems from the network.
Quarantine impacted user accounts and groups.
Block malicious IPs, domains, and C2 servers.
3.2 Quarantine Steps:
Quarantine infected systems.
Quarantine affected users and groups.
Quarantine file shares and shared databases.
Quarantine backups, if not already secured.
Block command and control domains and addresses.
Remove vector emails from inboxes.
Confirm endpoint protection is up-to-date and enabled on all systems.
Confirm patches are deployed on all systems.
Deploy custom signatures to endpoint protection and network security tools based on discovered IOCs.
Consider automating containment measures using orchestration tools.
4. Eradication: : 4.1 Remediation Steps:
Rebuild infected systems from known-good media.
Restore from known-clean backups.
Confirm endpoint protection is up-to-date and enabled on all systems.
Confirm patches are deployed on all systems.
Deploy custom signatures to endpoint protection and network security tools based on discovered IOCs.
Watch for re-infection: consider increased priority for alarms/alerts related to this incident.
5. Recovery: : 5.1 Recovery Steps:
Launch business continuity/disaster recovery plans.
Recover data from known-clean backups to known-clean, patched, monitored systems.
Check backups for indicators of compromise.
Consider partial recovery and backup integrity testing.
Find and try known decryptors for the variant(s) discovered using resources like the No More Ransom! Project's Decryption Tools page.
Consider ramifications with appropriate stakeholders for paying the ransom (e.g., finance, legal, regulatory, insurance).
6. Lessons Learned: : 6.1 Steps:
Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps and improvements.
Update the incident response playbook based on findings.
6.2 Report and Document:
Compile a detailed incident report.
Ensure all incident documentation is complete and stored securely.
6.3 Improve Defenses:
Implement additional security controls as needed.
Review and enhance backup and recovery procedures.

7 Additional Contents
7.1 Tools and Resources:
Detection Tools: SIEM, EDR, antivirus, and IDS/IPS solutions.
Analysis Tools: Forensic analysis tools, ID Ransomware, Crypto Sheriff.
Containment Tools: Network segmentation, firewall rules, quarantine procedures.
Eradication and Recovery Tools: Backup and restore solutions, patch management tools, antivirus and EDR.
7.2 Important Notes:
Do Not Pay Ransom: Paying the ransom does not guarantee data recovery and encourages further attacks.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all actions comply with relevant laws and regulations.
Insurance and Law Enforcement: Engage with insurance providers and consider notifying law enforcement as appropriate.</s>
