Please generate a Incident Response Playbook for Intentional Internal Information Disclosure incident? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Incident Response Playbook for Intentional Internal Information Disclosure
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
Contacts:
Internal Technical Contacts: Identify contacts in the security team, incident response team, and IT support.
Public Relations Team: Ensure contact points in the PR team for handling regulator institutions and public communications.
Human Resources and Legal Department: Establish contacts for coordinating internal disciplinary actions and legal implications.
External Contacts: Identify external contacts for investigation purposes, such as Law Enforcement.
Communication Strategy: Prepare both internal and external communication strategies, including contacts like DPO, CDO, and GDPR officers.
Security Policy:
Corporate Information Value: Ensure that the value of corporate information is explained in the procedures, IT policies, awareness, and training sessions.
Asset Identification: Ensure all valuable assets are properly identified and documented.
Incident Escalation Process: Define and document the security incident escalation process, clearly identifying the roles and responsibilities of all involved actors.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
Detect the Issue:
Incident Notification Process: Utilize internal information sources such as employee reports, security team alerts, and automated detection tools.
Public Monitoring Tools: Monitor Internet search engines, public databases, and ransomware shaming list websites for potential data leakage.
DLP Tools: Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to identify and alert on potential information leaks.
Confirm the Issue:
Data Leak Sources: Identify whether the leak is due to an individual employee (intentional or accidental) or a compromised system.
Email Investigation: Check the suspect's corporate email for sent/received data and related log files.
Browsing History: Investigate the suspect's web browsing history for potential data transfer through webmail, forums, or dedicated websites.
External Storage Devices: Identify usage of USB keys, CD-ROMs, DVDs, external hard drives, smartphones, or memory cards.
Local Files: Search the local file system for traces of leaked data using appropriate forensic tools.
Network Transfer: Review log files for FTP, instant messaging, VPN, SSH connections, and other network activities.
Printer Logs: Check for traces of data sent to network-connected printers.
Malware/Ransomware: Investigate if a malware/ransomware compromise is the source of the information leak.
Involve Law Enforcement: Consider involving law enforcement services and regulators if required.
Comprehensive Analysis: Always seek additional evidence to confirm the data leak.
Analyze Concerned Data if Available:
Leaked Data Analysis: Download and analyze leaked data using tools like Aleph to help legal teams decide on further actions.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.
Notify Management and Legal Teams:
Ensure management, legal, and PR teams are prepared for potential disclosure.
Block Leakage Vectors:
Block access to the disclosure URI, server, source, or recipients across all infrastructure points.
Suspend the insider's credentials (logical and physical) if leakage is confirmed, in coordination with HR and legal teams.
Isolate computing systems used for data disclosure for forensic analysis (e.g., disconnect power and battery).
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.
Remove Disclosed Data:
Request the removal of disclosed data from public servers (tailor requests to the recipient, considering their nature, e.g., hacktivism vs. press).
Monitor and Analyze:
If removal is not possible, provide a detailed analysis to the PR team and management. Monitor the spread of leaked documents on websites, social networks, and public reactions.
Provide evidence to the HR team for potential disciplinary actions against the insider.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the System to Normal Operations
System Restoration:
Fully restore compromised systems to normal operations.
Raise awareness among employees and local teams about the issue and reinforce security rules.
Remove official communications related to the incident once the situation is resolved.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the Incident’s Details, Discuss Lessons Learned, and Adjust Plans and Defenses
Inform and Share:
Inform hierarchy, subsidiaries, and partners about the incident and best practices applied.
Incident Report:
Content: Write a detailed incident report covering the initial cause of the incident, actions taken, timelines, successes, failures, impact, and indicators of compromise.
Distribution: Share the report with all incident actors, and create an executive summary for management.
Capitalize on Experience:
Define actions to improve the information leakage handling processes based on the incident experience.
Review and update security measures, such as network segmentation, firewall configuration, application security, patching procedures, and training programs.
Conduct a post-incident review meeting to discuss what went well, what did not, and how to prevent future incidents.</s>
