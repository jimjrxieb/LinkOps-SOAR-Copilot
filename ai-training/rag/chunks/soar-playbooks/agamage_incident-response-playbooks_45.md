Title: : Malware Incident Response Playbook for OT Environment
1. Preparation: : Identify Critical Assets:
Documentation: Maintain an inventory of all critical OT assets, including SCADA systems, PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, and any connected devices. Include details about their configurations, software versions, and network connections.
Prioritization: Assign criticality levels to each asset based on their role in operations and potential impact of a malware infection.
Security Assessments:
Regular Audits: Conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify vulnerabilities in OT systems. Use tools like Nessus, Qualys, or custom OT security assessment tools.
Patch Management: Implement a patch management process to ensure timely application of security updates and patches to OT systems and software.
Incident Response Team (IRT):
Team Formation: Form a dedicated IRT with members from IT, OT, cybersecurity, and operations departments. Include roles such as incident commander, malware analysts, network security specialists, and communication officers.
Roles and Responsibilities: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. Ensure redundancy in critical roles to cover absences.
Training:
Regular Training: Conduct regular training sessions, including workshops on malware detection and response, and hands-on exercises simulating malware attacks.
Awareness Programs: Develop awareness programs to educate staff on the signs of malware infection and safe practices to prevent infection.
Tools:
Anti-Malware Software: Deploy anti-malware solutions tailored for OT environments, such as whitelisting software and behavior-based detection tools.
Network Monitoring Tools: Use network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns that could indicate malware activity.
SIEM: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs from OT systems.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Isolate Infected Systems:
Isolation Procedures: Isolate infected systems immediately to prevent the spread of malware. DO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.
Preservation: Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation, including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.
Investigate Malware Context:
User Context Investigation: Determine if the malware is running under a user context. If so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.
Malware Analysis:
Characteristics Analysis: Analyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak. Use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform this analysis.
IoCs Collection: Observe any network connectivity attempts, files created or modified by the malware, and note the location of the malware on the infected system. Preserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password-protected zip file. Use PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s) and gather additional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.).
Network Connectivity: Note that network activity from malware may alert an attacker of your investigation; thus, network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances.
Utilize IoCs:
Search Tools: Use all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.
Associated Attacks: Determine if the malware is associated with further attacks (e.g., Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks).
Initial Point of Entry:
Identify Entry Point: Use all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry. Determine the first appearance of the malware and the user first impacted by the malware. Investigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.
Analyze Vectors: Analyze all possible vectors for infection, focusing on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).
3. Containment: : Close Entry Points:
Gap Closure: Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps. Examples include firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, and user education.
Isolate Additional Infected Hosts:
Device Isolation: Once the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.
Update Endpoint Protection:
IoCs Addition: Add IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection. Set to block and alert upon detection.
Community Sources: Submit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection. Note: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.
Prevent Escalation:
Apply Controls: If additional further attacks were noted as associated with the malware, use IoCs and threat-intel to apply additional controls to prevent the attack from escalating.
Implement Network Rules:
Temporary Rules: Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.
Account Management: If additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.
4. Eradication: : Artifact Preservation:
Preserve Artifacts: Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. This may be important for future forensics. If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives. If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.
Volatile Data: Preserve any volatile data collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).
System Replacement:
Replace Systems: Once all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.
5. Recovery: : Restore Systems:
Clean Backup Restoration: Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available. For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.
Vulnerability Remediation:
Remediate Vulnerabilities: Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation. This includes applying patches, closing unnecessary ports, and enhancing security configurations.
Account Management:
Reset Passwords: Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.
Ongoing Monitoring:
Extended Monitoring: Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period. Configure alerts to aid in quick detection and response.
6. Lessons Learned: : Post-Incident Review:
Meeting: Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss what went well and what did not. Identify vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status and determine how they will be remediated. Discuss further steps or actions that would have been helpful in preventing the incident.
Security Measure Review:
Review and Update: Review and update security measures such as network segmentation, firewall configuration, application security, OS and application patching procedures, and training programs for employees, IT, or CSIRT.
Incident Report:
Report Creation: Create and distribute an incident report to relevant parties. A primary, more technical report should be completed for the CSIRT. An executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>
