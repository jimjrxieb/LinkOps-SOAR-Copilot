Please generate a Incident Response Playbook for Intentional Internal Information Disclosure incident? [/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.
Title: : Incident Response Playbook for Intentional Internal Information Disclosure
1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.
Contacts:
Internal Technical Contacts:
Security Team: Ensure contact details for all security team members are updated.
Incident Response Team (IRT): Confirm roles and responsibilities and ensure contact information is readily available.
Public Relations Team:
Identify key contacts responsible for handling communications with regulator institutions and the public.
Human Resources and Legal Department:
Ensure you have up-to-date contacts for coordinating internal disciplinary actions and legal implications.
External Contacts:
Law Enforcement: Have contact information for local and national law enforcement agencies.
External Forensic Experts: Maintain contacts for forensic analysis and investigation.
Communication Strategy:
Develop internal communication plans for informing staff and management.
Develop external communication plans for public statements, press releases, and regulatory notifications.
Ensure Data Protection Officer (DPO), Chief Data Officer (CDO), and GDPR contacts are included.
Security Policy:
Corporate Information Value:
Clearly explain the importance of corporate information in all procedural documents, IT policies, and during training sessions.
Asset Identification:
Maintain an updated list of all valuable assets, including details on their classification and importance.
Incident Escalation Process:
Define and document the incident escalation process, ensuring that all actors and their roles are clearly identified.
2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
Detect the Issue:
Incident Notification Process:
Encourage employees to report any suspicious activity or data breaches immediately.
Ensure the security team monitors for internal issues regularly.
Public Monitoring Tools:
Set up alerts on search engines and monitor public databases for mentions of the company.
Regularly check ransomware shaming list websites for potential data leaks.
DLP Tools:
Utilize Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to detect and alert on potential data leakage incidents.
Confirm the Issue:
Data Leak Sources:
Ensure no actions are taken without written requests from the CISO or the person in charge.
Consult with the legal team and get written permission from the concerned user if necessary.
Email Investigation:
Check corporate email logs for suspicious activities, such as emails sent to or received from unknown accounts.
Use email clients to search for flagged emails and related log files, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.
Browsing History:
Investigate browsing histories on all installed browsers on the suspect’s desktop for visits to webmail, forums, or specific URLs used to disclose data.
External Storage Devices:
Check logs for the use of USB keys, external hard drives, and other storage devices on the suspect’s system.
Local Files:
Use forensic tools to search for traces of leaked data in the local file system.
Network Transfer:
Review FTP, instant messaging, VPN, and SSH logs for data transfer activities.
Printer Logs:
Investigate network-connected printers’ logs for traces of printed sensitive data.
Malware/Ransomware:
Assess if malware or ransomware could be the source of the information leak and follow specific malware/ransomware IR protocols.
Involve Law Enforcement:
Involve law enforcement and regulatory bodies if required.
Comprehensive Analysis:
Continue gathering evidence even after initial confirmation to ensure thorough investigation and coverage of all potential data leak methods.
Analyze Concerned Data if Available:
Leaked Data Analysis:
Download and analyze any leaked data using tools like Aleph to assist legal teams in deciding the next steps.
3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.
Notify Management and Legal Teams:
Ensure management, legal, and PR teams are prepared for potential disclosure.
Block Leakage Vectors:
Block Access: Block access to the disclosure URI, server, source, or recipients across all infrastructure points.
Suspend Credentials: Suspend logical and physical credentials of the insider if the leakage is confirmed, coordinating with HR and legal teams.
Isolate Systems: Isolate computing systems used for data disclosure by physically removing power and batteries (for laptops) to preserve forensic evidence.
4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.
Remove Disclosed Data:
Public Servers: Request the removal of disclosed data from public servers, tailoring the request to the recipient’s nature (e.g., hacktivism vs. press).
Monitor and Analyze:
Monitor Spread: If removal is not possible, monitor the spread of leaked documents on websites, social networks, and public reactions.
HR Actions: Provide evidence to the HR team for potential disciplinary actions against the insider.
5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.
System Restoration:
Restore Systems: Fully restore compromised systems to normal operations using clean backups or rebuilding from known good images.
Raise Awareness: Inform employees about the issue to raise awareness and reinforce security practices.
Remove Communications: Once the situation is resolved, remove any official communications related to the incident.
6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.
Inform and Share:
Best Practices: Share best practices and lessons learned with hierarchy, subsidiaries, and partners to reinforce security measures across locations.
Incident Report:
Report Creation: Create a detailed incident report covering the initial cause, actions taken, timelines, successes, failures, impact, and indicators of compromise.
Distribution: Distribute the report to all involved actors and present an executive summary to management.
Capitalize on Experience:
Process Improvement: Define actions to improve information leakage handling processes based on the incident experience.
Security Measures Review: Regularly review and update security measures, such as network segmentation, firewall configuration, application security, OS/application patching procedures, and training programs.
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a post-incident review meeting to discuss what went well, what did not, and how to prevent future incidents.</s>
