Be specific about the traffic you\u2019d like to control:\nNetwork blocks involved\nSource IP addresses\nProtocols\nNotify your company\u2019s executive and legal teams.\n2.4 Check the Background\nFind out whether the company received an extortion demand as a precursor to the attack:\nCheck for emails in your security email gateway based on a keyword list.\nSome threat actors send extortion demands directly to the email addresses in the Whois records of the targeted website.\nLook for revendications of the attack on Social Medias.\nSearch if anyone would have any interest in threatening your company:\nCompetitors\nIdeologically-motivated groups (hacktivists)\nFormer employees\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack\u2019s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Containment Actions\nIf the bottleneck is a particular feature of an application, temporarily disable that feature.\nAttempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network\u2019s \u201ccloud\u201d as possible via a router, firewall, load balancer, specialized device, etc.\nTerminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers and tune their TCP/IP settings.\nIf possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP addresses.\nSet up an alternate communication channel between you and your users/customers \nIf possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or product via DNS or routing changes \nConfigure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in response to DDoS traffic to avoid adding unnecessary packets to the network.\nIn case of an extortion attempt, try to buy time with the fraudster. For example, explain that you need more time in order to get management approval.\n3.2 ISP or Anti-DDoS Service Actions\nIf the bottleneck is at the ISP\u2019s or anti-DDoS service\u2019s side, only they can take efficient actions. In that case, work closely with your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure you share information efficiently.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remediation Measures\nContact your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure that they enforce remediation measures.

Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 General Signs of Ransomware Presence\nSeveral leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:\nMonitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.\nSupervision of EDR alerts.\nOdd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.\nA ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on the user\u2019s desktop.\nPeople are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).\nNumerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.\nPublication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.\nLateral movement is usually done; check all connections to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal times.\nLook for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.), or Bitcoin payment websites.\nLook for rare connections.\n2.2 Immediate Response\nIf a machine is identified with ransomware, unplug it from the network and keep it turned on for memory forensics investigation.\n\n2.3 Scoping of the Incident\nEDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allow the scoping of the ransomware-infected machines.\nThe identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in large-scale malware compromise. This allows establishing the following phases actions.\n2.4 Threat Actor Identification\nThe identification of the Threat Actor at the origin of the ransomware attack could help the following phases based on known TTPs.\nRansomware network compromise identification has many similarities with large-scale malware compromise. Most of the time, reaction decisions must be taken faster in ransomware cases.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack\u2019s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.2 Follow Defined Posture\nFollow the posture defined in the preparation phase.\n3.3 Security Provider Actions\nSend the undetected samples to your endpoint security provider and/or private sandboxes.\nSend the uncategorized malicious URLs, domain names, and IPs to your perimeter security provider.\nBlock traffic to C2s.\nBlock any IP detected as used by attackers.\n3.4 Isolation\nIsolate compromised VLANs, interconnections, entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\nDisable accounts compromised/created by attackers.\nDisconnect all computers that have been detected as compromised from the network.\nYou could isolate with EDR and shut down the internet while keeping EDR connections up.\nIf you cannot isolate computers, disconnect/cancel the shared drives.\n(NET USE x: \\unc\\path\\ /DELETE).\nMonitor ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet for any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n\n3.5 Public Statement\nMake a public statement as soon as possible based on the communication template elaborated in the preparation phase.\n4.

This includes disabling unnecessary services and ports, applying security patches, and enforcing least privilege principles.\nEnsure proper network segmentation to limit the spread of potential future attacks.\nUse network access control (NAC) to enforce security policies on devices trying to access the network.\nThird-Party and Vendor Assessment:\nConduct a thorough review of third-party connections and vendor access to the network.\nImplement stricter controls and monitoring for third-party access.\nEnsure all third-party services and software are up to date and secure.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Antivirus and Malicious Binaries\nUpdate antivirus signatures for identified malicious binaries to be blocked.\nEnsure that no malicious binaries are present on the systems before reconnecting them.\nEnsure that the network traffic is back to normal.\n5.2 Document Restoration\nRestore user\u2019s documents from backups.\nPrioritize your recovery plan based on your DRP (disaster recovery plan).\nAll of these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and with technical monitoring.\n5.3 Backup Verification and System Reimaging\nVerify that backups are not compromised: only restore from a backup if you are very confident that the backup and the device you are connecting it to are clean.\nOR reimage the computer with a clean install.\n5.4 Credential Reset\nReset credentials including passwords (especially for administrator and other system accounts).\n5.5 Network Monitoring\nMonitor network traffic to identify if any infection remains.\nIf possible, apply geo-filtering on firewalls to block illegitimate foreign country traffic.\nMaintain the monitoring ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet to find if there is any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident\u2019s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Incident Report\nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the stakeholders. The following themes should be described:\nInitial cause of the infection.\nActions and timelines of every important event.\nWhat went right.\nWhat went wrong.\nIncident cost.\nIndicators of compromise.\n6.2 Capitalize\nActions to improve malware and network intrusion detection processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.299308"}

These may be important for future forensics.\nIf rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.\nIf rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nPreserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases.\nThis may include log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.\nOnce all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.\nFor systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nRemediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.\nReset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nContinue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.\nAlerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.\nIf data exfiltration and extortion were determined to be part of this attack, work with legal counsel to determine next steps.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:\nWhat things went well during the investigation?\nWhat things did not go well during the investigation?\nWhat vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization\u2019s security status were identified?\nHow will these be remediated?\nWhat further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?\nReview and update security measures:\nNetwork segmentation\nFirewall configuration\nApplication security\nOperating System and/or Application patching procedures\nEmployee, IT, or CSIRT training\nCreate and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.\nA primary, and more technical, report should be completed for the CSIRT.\nAn executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.299599"}

[/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Incident Response Playbook for social engineering incident by phone or e-mail\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\nRaise user awareness and security policies.\nNever give any personal or corporate information to an unidentified person. This could include user IDs, passwords, account information, name, e-mail address, phone (mobile or landline) numbers, address, social security number, job titles, information on clients, organization orIT systems. The goal of the social engineer is to steal human resources, corporate secrets or customer/user data. \nReport any suspicious event to your manager, who will forward it to the CISO in orderto have a centralized reporting. \nHave a defined process to redirect any \u201cweird\u201d request to a \u201cred\u201d phone, if needed. \nPrepare to handle conversation with social engineers to identify which information could help tracking the attacker and his goals. \nCheck your legal department to see which actions are allowed and which reactions they can handle.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\nPhone call / someone you don't know calls you/your service, asking for detailed information. \nIf the contact works out of the company and requests for information that could be valuable for a competitor, deny his requests and go to part 3.\nIf the contact pretends to be an employee of your company but the phone number is hidden or not internal, propose that you call back to the declared number in the directory. If the supposedly attacker agrees, call back to check. If he rejects this option, go to part 3.\nThe attacker might use several techniques to entice his victim to speak (fear, curiosity, empathy ...). Do not disclose information in any case. Listen carefully to his requests and at the end ask for a phone number to call back or an email address to reply. Take notes and stay calm, even if the attacker is shouting or threatening, remember he tries to use human weaknesses.\n\nIf you can go further, the following information will be precious: \nthe name of the correspondent \nrequested information / people \naccent, language skills \nindustry language and organizational knowledge \nbackground noises \ntime and duration of the call \nE-mail / Someone you don't know requests detailed information: \nIf the contact has an \u201cout of the company\u201d e-mail address and requests information that could be valuable for a competitor, go to part 3. \nIf the contact uses an internal e-mail address but is asking for weird information, ask him some explanations and use the company directory to get his manager's name that you'll place as a copy.\nEventually notify top management to inform them that an incident has been encountered relating to a social engineering attack. They might understand the goals depending on the context.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack\u2019s effects on the targeted environment.\nAt this step, you should be pretty sure that you're dealing with a social engineering attack. \n\nActions for all employees: \nPhone call \nIf the attacker urges you to give a phone number, follow these steps: \nUse the \u201cred phone line\u201d from your CERT/CSIRT, if existing. \nGive him the number with an invented name. \nImmediately call your CERT/CSIRT team explaining what happened and the chosen invented name. \nIf the attacker stresses you too much and does not let you time to find the Red Phone number, ask him to call you back later, pretending a meeting. If the attacker wants to reach someone, follow these points : \nPlace on hold the attacker and call CERT/CSIRT team and explain what happened. \nTransfer the conversation of the attacker to CERT/CSIRT team (do not give him the number). \n\nE-mail \nForward to your security team all email including headers (send as attached documents) for investigation purposes. It might help to track the attacker.\nActions for CERT or incidentresponse team: \n\u25aa Phone call Resume the conversation with the attacker and use one of these techniques: \nImpersonate the identity of the people whom the attacker is willing to speak \nSlow down and make last the conversation and entice the attacker to make mistake \nExplain him that social engineering attack is forbidden by law, punished by sanctions and that lawyer team will handle the issue if it continues \nIf the trap phone number has been used, prepare to \u201cburn it\u201d, create another one and display it in the directory. \n\u25aa E-mail \nCollect as much information as possible on the email address \nAnalyze the email headers and try to locate the source \nSearch the e-mail address with Internet tools \nGeolocalize the user behind the email address\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\nSome possible remediation actions can be tried: \nAlert the law enforcement and/or file a complaint \nDiscuss the problem in circles of trust to know if the company is facing this issue alone \nThreaten the attacker with legal actions if he can be identified \nReport email addresses used by the attacker to the provider abuse teams\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\nNotify the top management of the actions and the decisions taken on the social engineering case.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident\u2019s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\nInform your hierarchy and subsidiaries about the incident, this could help to avoid similar attacks later. \nReport \nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the actors of the incident. \nThe following themes should be described: \nInitial cause of the infection \nActions and timelines of every important event \nWhat went right \nWhat went wrong \nIncident cost (direct and indirect losses) \nIndicators of compromise \n\nCapitalize \nActions to improve the social engineering handling processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience, especially awareness.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.299740"}

Include details about their configurations, software versions, and network connections.\nPrioritization: Assign criticality levels to each asset based on their role in operations and potential impact of a malware infection.\nSecurity Assessments:\nRegular Audits: Conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify vulnerabilities in OT systems. Use tools like Nessus, Qualys, or custom OT security assessment tools.\nPatch Management: Implement a patch management process to ensure timely application of security updates and patches to OT systems and software.\nIncident Response Team (IRT):\nTeam Formation: Form a dedicated IRT with members from IT, OT, cybersecurity, and operations departments. Include roles such as incident commander, malware analysts, network security specialists, and communication officers.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. Ensure redundancy in critical roles to cover absences.\nTraining:\nRegular Training: Conduct regular training sessions, including workshops on malware detection and response, and hands-on exercises simulating malware attacks.\nAwareness Programs: Develop awareness programs to educate staff on the signs of malware infection and safe practices to prevent infection.\nTools:\nAnti-Malware Software: Deploy anti-malware solutions tailored for OT environments, such as whitelisting software and behavior-based detection tools.\nNetwork Monitoring Tools: Use network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns that could indicate malware activity.\nSIEM: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs from OT systems.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Isolate Infected Systems:\nIsolation Procedures: Isolate infected systems immediately to prevent the spread of malware. DO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.\nPreservation: Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation, including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.\nInvestigate Malware Context:\nUser Context Investigation: Determine if the malware is running under a user context. If so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.\nMalware Analysis:\nCharacteristics Analysis: Analyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak. Use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform this analysis.\nIoCs Collection: Observe any network connectivity attempts, files created or modified by the malware, and note the location of the malware on the infected system. Preserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password-protected zip file. Use PowerShell \u201cGet-FileHash\u201d cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s) and gather additional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.).\nNetwork Connectivity: Note that network activity from malware may alert an attacker of your investigation; thus, network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances.\nUtilize IoCs:\nSearch Tools: Use all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nAssociated Attacks: Determine if the malware is associated with further attacks (e.g., Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks).\nInitial Point of Entry:\nIdentify Entry Point: Use all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry. Determine the first appearance of the malware and the user first impacted by the malware. Investigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.\nAnalyze Vectors: Analyze all possible vectors for infection, focusing on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).\n3. Containment: : Close Entry Points:\nGap Closure: Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps. Examples include firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, and user education.\nIsolate Additional Infected Hosts:\nDevice Isolation: Once the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.\nUpdate Endpoint Protection:\nIoCs Addition: Add IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection. Set to block and alert upon detection.\nCommunity Sources: Submit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection. Note: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.\nPrevent Escalation:\nApply Controls: If additional further attacks were noted as associated with the malware, use IoCs and threat-intel to apply additional controls to prevent the attack from escalating.\nImplement Network Rules:\nTemporary Rules: Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.\nAccount Management: If additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.\n4. Eradication: : Artifact Preservation:\nPreserve Artifacts: Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. This may be important for future forensics. If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives. If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nVolatile Data: Preserve any volatile data collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).\nSystem Replacement:\nReplace Systems: Once all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore Systems:\nClean Backup Restoration: Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available. For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nVulnerability Remediation:\nRemediate Vulnerabilities: Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation. This includes applying patches, closing unnecessary ports, and enhancing security configurations.\nAccount Management:\nReset Passwords: Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nOngoing Monitoring:\nExtended Monitoring: Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period. Configure alerts to aid in quick detection and response.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Post-Incident Review:\nMeeting: Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss what went well and what did not. Identify vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization\u2019s security status and determine how they will be remediated. Discuss further steps or actions that would have been helpful in preventing the incident.\nSecurity Measure Review:\nReview and Update: Review and update security measures such as network segmentation, firewall configuration, application security, OS and application patching procedures, and training programs for employees, IT, or CSIRT.\nIncident Report:\nReport Creation: Create and distribute an incident report to relevant parties. A primary, more technical report should be completed for the CSIRT. An executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.300076"}

[/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Ransomware Incident Response Playbook\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\n1.1 A good knowledge of:\nThe usual operating systems security policies is needed.\nThe usual users\u2019 profile policies is needed.\n1.2 Architecture, VLAN segmentation and interconnections:\nHave the capability to isolate entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\n1.3 Security Product Updates\nEnsure that the endpoint and perimeter (email gateway, proxy caches) security products are up to date.\n1.4 Deploy an EDR solution on endpoints and servers:\nThis tool became one of the cornerstones of the incident response in case of ransomware or in large-scale compromise, facilitating identification, containment, and remediation phases.\nLaunch EDR Search and AV scan with IOC explicit rules and get first indicators for remediation progress following.\nSet the EDR policies in prevent mode.\n1.5 IT Support Awareness\nSince this threat is often detected by end-users, raise the IT support awareness regarding the ransomware threat.\n1.6 Block IOCs\nBlock IOCs linked to ransomware activities gathered by Threat Intelligence.\n1.7 Deploy and operate security solutions enabling detection and facilitating response:\nLog gathering in a SIEM.\nHave the capacity to run tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC (ANSSI).\n1.8 Backups Preparation\nMake sure to have exhaustive, recent, and reliable backups of local and network users\u2019 data.\nFollow the 3-2-1 backup rules:\nAt least three copies: three different copies in different places. By keeping them in different places, it reduces the risk of a single event destroying multiple copies.\nIn two different formats: this means that you must use at least two different methods to store the data. For example, DVD, Hard drive, Cloud services are different formats. But if you store two copies on two hard drives, you are just using one format.\nWith one of those copies offsite: Keeping one copy off-site ensures that even if whatever happens where the data is (fire, break-in, natural disaster) at least one copy is safe somewhere else. In this rule, cloud services make sense.\nTry to use one backup format stored out of the network: even if lateral movement happens from the threat that harms the network with encryption, one copy will be out of reach.\n1.9 Log Management\nHave good log retention and verbosity.\n1.10 Posture and Communication\nDefine a strict posture versus the attacker.\nPrepare internal and external communication strategy.\n1.11 Immediate Response\nIf a machine is identified with ransomware, unplug it from the network and keep it turned on for memory forensics investigation.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 General Signs of Ransomware Presence\nSeveral leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:\nMonitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.\nSupervision of EDR alerts.\nOdd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.\nA ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on the user\u2019s desktop.\nPeople are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).\nNumerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.\nPublication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.\nLateral movement is usually done; check all connections to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal times.\nLook for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.), or Bitcoin payment websites.\nLook for rare connections.\n2.2 Scoping of the Incident\nEDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allow the scoping of the ransomware-infected machines.\nThe identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in large-scale malware compromise. This allows establishing the following phase actions.\n2.3 Threat Actor Identification\nThe identification of the Threat Actor at the origin of the ransomware attack could help the following phases based on known TTPs.\nRansomware network compromise identification has many similarities with large-scale malware compromise. Most of the time, reaction decisions must be taken faster in ransomware cases. For more details about large-scale malware compromise, please refer to IRM-18.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack\u2019s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Public Statement\nMake a public statement as soon as possible based on the communication template elaborated in the preparation phase.\n3.2 Follow Defined Posture\nFollow the posture defined in the preparation phase.\n3.3 Security Provider Actions\nSend the undetected samples to the endpoint security provider and/or private sandboxes.\nSend the uncategorized malicious URLs, domain names, and IPs to the perimeter security provider.\nBlock traffic to C2s.\nBlock any IP detected as used by attackers.\n3.4 Isolation\nIsolate compromised VLANs, interconnections, entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\nDisable accounts compromised/created by attackers.\nDisconnect all computers that have been detected as compromised from the network.\nYou could isolate with EDR and shut down the internet while keeping EDR connections up.\nIf you cannot isolate computers, disconnect or cancel the shared drives.\n(NET USE x: \\unc\\path\\ /DELETE).\nMonitor ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet for any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remove Threat\nRemove the initial access used by the attacker.\nRemove binaries used by the attacker to move laterally on the network.\nRemove any accounts created by attackers.\nRevert configuration changes.\nOperate systems and network configuration hardening.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Antivirus and Malicious Binaries\nUpdate antivirus signatures for identified malicious binaries to be blocked.\nEnsure that no malicious binaries are present on the systems before reconnecting them.\nEnsure that the network traffic is back to normal.\n5.2 Document Restoration\nRestore user\u2019s documents from backups.\nPrioritize the recovery plan based on the DRP (disaster recovery plan).\nAll of these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and with technical monitoring.\n5.3 Backup Verification and System Reimaging\nVerify that backups are not compromised: only restore from a backup if you are very confident that the backup and the device you are connecting it to are clean.\nOR reimage the computer with a clean install.\n5.4 Credential Reset\nReset credentials including passwords (especially for administrator and other system accounts).\n5.5 Network Monitoring\nMonitor network traffic to identify if any infection remains.\nIf possible, apply geo-filtering on firewalls to block illegitimate foreign country traffic.\nMaintain the monitoring ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet to find if there is any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident\u2019s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Report\nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the stakeholders. The following themes should be described:\nInitial cause of the infection.\nActions and timelines of every important event.\nWhat went right.\nWhat went wrong.\nIncident cost.\nIndicators of compromise.\n6.2 Capitalize\nActions to improve malware and network intrusion detection processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.300126"}

[/INST] Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Incident Response Playbook for Website Defacement Attack\n1. Preparation: : 1.1 Establish Incident Response Team (IRT)\nDefine roles and responsibilities for all team members.\nEnsure all team members are trained and understand their roles in a website defacement scenario.\n1.2 Establish Communication Protocols\nDefine communication channels and protocols for internal and external communication during an incident.\nPrepare templates for notifying stakeholders, including customers and regulatory bodies.\n1.3 Implement Security Measures\nEnsure regular updates and patches for all software and systems.\nUse web application firewalls (WAF) to protect against common attacks.\nImplement strong access control measures and regularly review permissions.\n1.4 Conduct Regular Security Audits\nPerform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.\nAddress identified vulnerabilities promptly.\n1.5 Create Backup and Recovery Plans\nRegularly backup website data and store it securely.\nTest backup and recovery processes to ensure they work as expected.\n1.6 Set Up Monitoring and Detection Systems\nImplement continuous monitoring tools to detect unusual activities and potential defacement attempts.\nUse automated website scanners to regularly check for vulnerabilities and defacement.\nImplement defenses against common exploitation points such as SQL injections and XSS attacks.\nInstall programs specifically designed to detect website defacement incidents.\n1.7 Minimize Attack Surface\nUse as few plug-ins as necessary and remove any that are unused or outdated.\nEnsure all software and plug-ins are regularly updated to the latest versions.\n1.8 Close Monitoring and Mandate Access\nClosely monitor access to administrative content to ensure only authorized individuals have access.\nOnly grant access to individuals who need it, reducing the chance of human error leading to cyber attacks.\nDiscuss the importance of keeping administrative access limited and confidential with employees.\nConduct regular cybersecurity awareness training to reinforce these practices.\n1.9 Employee Training and Awareness\nConduct regular cybersecurity training for all employees.\nPromote awareness of the importance of security and how to recognize potential threats.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : 2.1 Immediately take the defaced server offline for further investigation\nThis is especially important if the defacement is insulting or triggering in any way. Remove this from the public eye as quickly as possible to avoid harm as well as to mitigate business impact.\nThe defacement message may also contain false information that could mislead users or put them at risk.\nTaking the server offline will allow a deeper investigation of the defacement. This may be necessary as the hacker may have dove deeper into the organization accessing application servers, databases, etc.\n2.2 Determine the system's source of vulnerability that was used by the attacker. Common exploits include:\nSQL injection attacks\nThis kind of attack occurs when an attacker interferes with an application's queries to the database. Therefore, this can lead to unauthorized access to private or sensitive data.\nRemote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks\nThis kind of attack exploits an application's referencing function to upload malware from a remote URL.\nWebshells\nPoor web application design\nJavaScript hacks\nPHP/ASP hacks\nOther methods of detection include:\nChecking the server logs\nLook through the web page's access log and error log for any suspicious or unfamiliar activity\nIt is also a good idea to check the IDS or IPS firewall logs, if available\nChecking files with static content\nScanning databases for malicious content\nChecking links present in the page\n2.3 Collect any clues as to who the hacker is or what organization they are working for. Consider the following questions:\nWhat did the defacement portray? Did it include an obvious message?\nDid the defacement seem harmless or intentional? Could the hacker be a kid messing around or a professional group working with a motive?\nDoes it seem like your organization was targeted? Who may want to target your organization?\nWhat did the hacker hope to accomplish?\nConsult here to learn more about the types of hackers that may have attacked your webpage.\n2.4 Collect other important information from the page that has been defaced such as:\nA screenshot of the defacement\nThe domain and IP address of the page\nDetails of the web server\nPage's source code\nAnalyze this carefully to identify the problem and ensure that it is on a server belonging to the company\nName or any information on the attacker\n2.5 There are also tools available to aid in both detection and log analysis. A few are listed below:\nWeblog Expert\nSawmill\nDeep Log Analyzer\n3. Containment: : 3.1 Backup all data stored on the web server for forensic purposes.\n3.2 As previously mentioned, make sure to take the defaced page's server down temporarily while the investigation occurs.\nHave an error page prepared for this situation that informs user and/or employees that maintenance is underway and the page they sought will return shortly.\nhave a backup website prepared where you may publish content while investigation and remediation are underway and have your temporary error page redirect users to this backup site.\nCheck network architecture map. If the breach is another system on the network, take that down and investigate it.\n3.3 Once the source of the attack has been determined, apply the necessary steps to ensure this will not happen again. This may include modifying code or editing access rights.\nReference the \"Investigate\" section for common sources of vulnerability.\nIf this is outside of your domain, simply ensure that you have given the appropriate personnel all the information on the attack that you have and allow experts to do their job.\n4. Eradication: : 4.1 Remove the hacker's message and replace it with original, legitimate content. If data was lost in the attack, reference backups and restore the original page as much as possible.\nCheck backups for indicators of compromise\nConsider partial recovery and backup integrity testing\n4.2 Consider asking users to change their login credentials if the web server has user authentication.\n5. Recovery: : 5.1 After implementing risk avoidance measures (as recommended below), restore your server showing the original page content.\n5.2 If necessary and/or applicable, prepare an apology/explanation of the attack that occurred for users or anyone who witnessed the defacement. Ensure that it is clear that the defacement content does not reflect your organization in any way.\n6. Lessons Learned: : 6.1 Post-Incident Review\nConduct a thorough post-incident review to understand the root cause of the defacement.\nIdentify what worked well and what could be improved in the response process.\n6.2 Documentation and Reporting\nDocument all findings, actions taken, and outcomes of the incident.\nPrepare a detailed report for stakeholders and leadership, highlighting lessons learned and areas for improvement.\n6.3 Update Incident Response Plan\nRevise the incident response plan based on lessons learned.\nIncorporate new procedures, tools, and best practices identified during the incident response.\n6.4 Share Knowledge\nShare lessons learned with relevant teams and stakeholders to improve overall organizational security posture.\nConduct training sessions or workshops to disseminate findings and recommendations.\n6.5 Continuous Improvement\nEstablish a process for continuous improvement of incident response capabilities.\nRegularly review and update security policies, procedures, and technologies to stay ahead of emerging threats.</s>\n\n", "incident_type": "General Incident", "response_type": "incident_response", "framework": "NIST", "content_type": "ir_playbook", "dataset": "agamage/incident-response-playbooks", "category": "ir_playbooks_extended", "priority": "high", "downloaded_at": "2025-08-24T02:23:51.300165"}
