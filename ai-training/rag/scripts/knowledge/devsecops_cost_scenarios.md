# Devsecops Cost Scenarios

# Scenario: Patching Resistance Due to Downtime Concerns

**Problem**: IT operations team resists applying critical vulnerability patches (CVE-2021-34527 PrintNightmare, Exchange ProxyShell) citing business outage risk and revenue impact.

**DevSecOps Practice**:
- Rolling patches with intelligent load balancer drain and health check validation
- Canary deployment on 10% of fleet → monitor metrics/logs → validate business functions → roll forward
- Emergency rollback capability using infrastructure snapshots (VMSS images, AMI backups, container digest pins)
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime patching of critical services

**Cost Analysis**:
- 2-hour planned downtime = $50,000 lost revenue (e-commerce baseline)
- Ransomware via unpatched vulnerability = $5.4M average recovery cost (IBM 2024)
- Rolling patch deployment = $5,000 DevOps engineering time vs $5.4M risk exposure
- ROI: 1,080x return on DevSecOps investment

**Actionable Implementation**:
1. **Pre-patch preparation**: Create VM snapshot, AMI backup, or container image baseline
2. **Staging validation**: Deploy patch to isolated staging environment matching production
3. **Automated testing**: Execute business-critical path validation (API health checks, user login flows)
4. **Phased rollout**: Patch 10% of load-balanced nodes, monitor for 2 hours
5. **Progressive deployment**: Scale to 50%, then 100% with continuous monitoring
6. **Rollback readiness**: Maintain 4-hour rollback window with automated triggers
7. **Post-patch validation**: 24-hour monitoring with defined success metrics

**Executive Communication**:
- "We can patch Exchange with <5 minutes downtime using rolling updates vs 2-week delay risking $5M+ breach"
- "Investment: $5K engineering time. Risk mitigation: $5.4M potential loss"
