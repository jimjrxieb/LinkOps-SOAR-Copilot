These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim’s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.\n\nFor example, cloud providers often limit customer usage of compute resources via quotas. Customers may request adjustments to these quotas to support increased computing needs, though these adjustments may require approval from the cloud provider. Adversaries who compromise a cloud environment may similarly request quota adjustments in order to support their activities, such as enabling additional [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496) without raising suspicion by using up a victim’s entire quota.(Citation: Microsoft Cryptojacking 2023) Adversaries may also increase allowed resource usage by modifying any tenant-wide policies that limit the sizes of deployed virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft Azure Policy)\n\nAdversaries may also modify settings that affect where cloud resources can be deployed, such as enabling [Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535). In Azure environments, an adversary who has gained access to a Global Administrator account may create new subscriptions in which to deploy resources, or engage in subscription hijacking by transferring an existing pay-as-you-go subscription from a victim tenant to an adversary-controlled tenant.(Citation: Microsoft Peach Sandstorm 2023) This will allow the adversary to use the victim’s compute resources without generating logs on the victim tenant.(Citation: Microsoft Azure Policy) (Citation: Microsoft Subscription Hijacking 2022)",

Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nThread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>SuspendThread </code>, <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012) but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.  \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.(Citation: NIST Authentication)(Citation: NIST MFA)\n\nCaching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) techniques.

To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).\n\nOn Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”.

Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.(Citation: Microsoft Kerberos Preauth 2014)\n\nFor each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4. The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002) attacks similarly to [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003) and expose plaintext credentials. (Citation: Harmj0y Roasting AS-REPs Jan 2017)(Citation: Stealthbits Cracking AS-REP Roasting Jun 2019) \n\nAn account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) with an LDAP filter. Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user. If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data. (Citation: Har",

An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.(Citation: Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017) This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.\n\nReflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.

The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.\n\nAcquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease)",

Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> and <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.

If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citati",

These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)\n\nFor example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)\n\nCompromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines.

TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).\n\nWhen an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon (`tccd`) checks the TCC database, located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (and `~/` equivalent), for existing permissions. If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.(Citation: welivesecurity TCC)\n\nAdversaries may manipulate the TCC database or otherwise abuse the TCC service to execute malicious content. This can be done in various ways, including using privileged system applications to execute malicious payloads or manipulating the database to grant their application TCC permissions. \n\nFor example, adversaries can use Finder, which has FDA permissions by default, to execute malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) while preventing a user prompt.

Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.\n\nSearch order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.\n\nFor example, \"example.exe\" runs \"cmd.exe\" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called \"net.exe\" within the same directory as example.exe, \"net.exe\" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called \"net.com\" in the same directory as \"net.exe\", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute \"net.com\" instead of \"net.exe\" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.

The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).\n\nThe sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.

Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.\n\nFor efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002).",

    "content": "---\nlanguage:\n- en\ntags:\n- cybersecurity\n- text\n- text-classification\n- text-generation\n- other\ntask_categories:\n- text-classification\n- text-generation\nlicense: mit\npretty_name: \"Open-MalSec\"\n---\n\n# Dataset Card for Open-MalSec\n\n## Dataset Description\n\n**Open-MalSec** is an open-source dataset curated for cybersecurity research and applications. It encompasses labeled data from diverse cybersecurity domains, including:\n\n- Phishing schematics  \n- Malware analysis reports  \n- Exploit documentation  \n- Vulnerability disclosures  \n- Scam methodologies and fraud intelligence  \n\nThis dataset integrates real-world samples with synthetic examples, offering broad coverage of threat vectors and attack strategies. Each data instance includes explicit annotations to facilitate machine learning applications such as classification, detection, and behavioral analysis. Open-MalSec is periodically updated to align with emerging threats and novel attack methodologies, ensuring ongoing relevance for both academic research and industry use.\n\n### Dataset Sources\n\n- **Repositories**: Combines public threat databases, cybersecurity whitepapers, real-world incident reports, and synthetic expansions.  \n- **Future Updates**: Contributions from the open-source community, supplemented by curated threat intelligence feeds.\n\n## Uses\n\nOpen-MalSec is designed to support a variety of cybersecurity-related tasks, including but not limited to:\n\n### Direct Use\n\n1. **Training and Fine-Tuning**: Model training for threat detection, phishing classification, malware behavior analysis, and vulnerability assessment.  \n2. **Forensic Analysis**: Automated scrutiny of logs, suspicious artifacts, or compromised system footprints.  \n3. **Research and Development**: Benchmarking novel AI methods for cyber threat intelligence, alert triaging, and risk analysis.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\n- **Unverified Production Deployments**: Deploying untested models based on this dataset for critical systems without rigorous validation or expert review.  \n- **Malicious Exploitation**: Leveraging the dataset to facilitate or enhance illicit cybersecurity activities.\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\nOpen-MalSec is organized into consistent data fields suitable for fine-tuning large language models and building specialized security tools.\n\n### Data Fields\n\n- **Instruction**: Task prompt or directive (e.g., “Analyze for phishing indicators”).  \n- **Input**: Contextual information (e.g., suspicious URLs, malware snippets, vulnerability descriptions).  \n- **Output**: Expected response (e.g., classification outcome, recommended actions).  \n- **Sentiment**: Contextual sentiment label (e.g., *Negative*, *Neutral*, *Positive*).  \n- **Score**: Numerical confidence value for the sentiment or classification.  \n- **Metadata**: Supplemental annotations, such as threat category, date of incident, or unique identifiers.\n\n### Data Instances\n\nOpen-MalSec is provided in JSON Lines (JSONL) format for straightforward integration with various machine learning frameworks. Below are representative examples:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Instruction\": \"Analyze the following statement for signs of phishing and provide recommendations:\",\n  \"Input\": \"Dear User, your account has been locked due to suspicious activity. Click here to reset your password: http://phishing-site.com\",\n  \"Output\": \"This is a phishing attempt. Recommendations: Do not click on the link and report the email to IT.\",\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Negative\",\n  \"Score\": 0.95,\n  \"Metadata\": {\"threat_type\": \"phishing\", \"source\": \"email\"}\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Instruction\": \"Summarize the malware analysis report and highlight key indicators of compromise.\",\n  \"Input\": \"The malware uses DLL sideloading techniques to evade detection...\",\n  \"Output\": \"DLL sideloading is employed to bypass security. Indicators include modified DLL files in system directories.\",\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Neutral\",\n  \"Score\": 0.88,\n  \"Metadata\": {\"threat_type\": \"malware\", \"platform\": \"Windows\"}\n}\n```\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n\nThe dataset was developed to address the increasing need for high-quality labeled data in cybersecurity. By consolidating data from multiple, diverse sources—both real incidents and synthetic scenarios—Open-MalSec provides a robust foundation for training, evaluating, and benchmarking AI models focused on threat detection and mitigation.\n\n### Source Data\n\n- **Data Collection**: Curated from public repositories, security research articles, and incident summaries. Synthetic entries are programmatically generated to emulate real-world patterns while ensuring broad coverage of various threat types.  \n- **Processing**: Data is standardized into the JSONL schema described above. Annotations are validated for consistency and quality through both automated checks and expert review.\n\n### Annotations\n\n- **Annotation Process**: Human annotators with cybersecurity expertise, assisted by automated detection tools, label and verify each example. Annotation guidelines include standardized threat classification taxonomies and sentiment scoring protocols.  \n- **Annotators**: Security professionals, researchers, and vetted contributors from the open-source community.  \n- **Personal & Sensitive Information**: Sensitive identifiers (e.g., emails, personal data) are anonymized or redacted where possible to maintain privacy and data protection standards.\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n- **Technical Limitations**: Certain threat vectors or advanced exploits may be underrepresented.  \n- **Data Bias**: Reliance on publicly reported incidents could introduce regional or industry biases. Synthetic examples aim to mitigate these imbalances but cannot guarantee full coverage.  \n- **Risk of Misuse**: The dataset could potentially be used by malicious actors to refine or test illicit tools.  \n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Validation**: Always validate model performance with up-to-date threats and conduct domain-specific testing before production deployments.  \n- **Continuous Updates**: Contribute additional threat data and corrections to enhance dataset completeness and accuracy.  \n- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: Employ the dataset responsibly, adhering to relevant data protection regulations and ethical guidelines.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use Open-MalSec in your research or production systems, please cite as follows:\n\n```bibtex\n@dataset{tegridydev_open_malsec_2025,\n  title     = {Open-MalSec: Advanced Cybersecurity Dataset},\n  author    = {TegridyDev},\n  year      = {2025},\n  license   = {MIT},\n  publisher = {Hugging Face Datasets}\n}\n```\n\n## Contact\n\nFor inquiries, contributions, or support, please reach out via the dataset repository on GitHub or contact the maintainer directly:\n\n- **Maintainer**: [TegridyDev](https://huggingface.co/tegridydev)\n- **Issues & Pull Requests**: [Open-MalSec GitHub](https://github.com/tegridydev/open-malsec)  \n\nWe welcome community feedback, additional labels, and expanded threat samples to keep Open-MalSec comprehensive and relevant.",

Don’t forget to include your critical customers, key partners, etc.\nDocument your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP addresses and circuit IDs, routing settings; prepare a network topology diagram and an asset inventory.\n1.3 Network Infrastructure\nDesign a good network infrastructure without Single Point of Failure or bottleneck.\nDeploy a Web Application Firewall to protect against application-layer DDoS.\nDistribute DNS servers and other critical services through different AS.\nHarden the configuration of network, OS, and application components that may be targeted by DDoS.\nBaseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can identify the attack faster and more accurately.\nConfirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be attacked. Lower the TTLs, if necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection if the original IP addresses get attacked. 600 is a good TTL value.\nDepending on the criticality of services, consider setting up a backup that you can switch on in case of issue.\n1.4 Internal Contacts\nEstablish contacts for your IDS, firewall, systems, and network teams.\nCollaborate with the business lines to understand business implications of likely DDoS attack scenarios.\nInvolve your BCP/DR planning team on DDoS incidents.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 Communication\nPrepare an internal and an external communication template about DDoS incidents.\nIdentify channel where this communication will be posted.\nThe “preparation” phase is to be considered as the most important element of a successful DDoS incident response.\n2.2 Analyze the Attack\nKeep in mind the DDoS attack could be a smokescreen hiding a more sophisticated and targeted attack.\nCheck your anti-DDoS service analysis and your scrubbing centre reports:\nUnderstand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the infrastructure components affected by it.\nUnderstand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim.\nReview the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls, applications, and other affected infrastructure.\nIdentify what aspects of the DDoS traffic differentiate it from benign traffic:\nSource IP addresses, AS, etc.\nDestination ports\nURLs\nProtocols flags\nNetwork analysis tools can be used to review the traffic: Tcpdump, Tshark, Snort, Netflow, Ntop, MRTG, Cacti, Nagios\nIf possible, create a NIDS signature to differentiate between benign and malicious traffic.\n2.3 Involve Internal and External Actors\nContact your internal teams to learn about their visibility into the attack.\nContact your ISP to ask for help. Be specific about the traffic you’d like to control:\nNetwork blocks involved\nSource IP addresses\nProtocols\nNotify your company’s executive and legal teams.\n2.4 Check the Background\nFind out whether the company received an extortion demand as a precursor to the attack:\nCheck for emails in your security email gateway based on a keyword list.\nSome threat actors send extortion demands directly to the email addresses in the Whois records of the targeted website.\nLook for revendications of the attack on Social Medias.\nSearch if anyone would have any interest in threatening your company:\nCompetitors\nIdeologically-motivated groups (hacktivists)\nFormer employees\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Containment Actions\nIf the bottleneck is a particular feature of an application, temporarily disable that feature.\nAttempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network’s “cloud” as possible via a router, firewall, load balancer, specialized device, etc.\nTerminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers and tune their TCP/IP settings.\nIf possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP addresses.\nSet up an alternate communication channel between you and your users/customers \nIf possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or product via DNS or routing changes \nConfigure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in response to DDoS traffic to avoid adding unnecessary packets to the network.\nIn case of an extortion attempt, try to buy time with the fraudster. For example, explain that you need more time in order to get management approval.\n3.2 ISP or Anti-DDoS Service Actions\nIf the bottleneck is at the ISP’s or anti-DDoS service’s side, only they can take efficient actions. In that case, work closely with your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure you share information efficiently.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remediation Measures\nContact your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider and make sure that they enforce remediation measures. Possible measures include:\nFiltering \nTraffic-scrubbing/Sinkhole/Clean-pipe\nIP public balancing/splitting/switching\nBlackhole Routing\nTechnical remediation actions can mostly be enforced by your ISP and/or anti-DDoS provider.\nIf the attack had a major impact, you may have to make an incident report to regulators.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Assess the End of the DDoS Condition\nEnsure that the impacted services are reachable again.\nEnsure that your infrastructure performance is back to your baseline performance.\n5.2 Rollback the Mitigation Measures\nSwitch back traffic to your original network.\nRestart stopped services.\nEnsure that the recovery-related actions are decided in accordance with the network teams. Bringing up services could have unexpected side effects.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Report\nAn incident report should be written and made available to all applicable actors. The following topics should be covered:\nInitial detection\nActions and timelines of every important event\nWhat went right\nWhat went wrong\nImpact from the incident\nIndicators of compromise\n6.2 Lessons Learned\nActions to improve the DDoS management processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience. Consider what relationships inside and outside your organizations could help you with future incidents.\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",

Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Incident Response Playbook for Ransomware Infection (NIST Compliant)\n1. Preparation: : Determine the members of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT).\nThe core CSIRT members should be comprised of individuals responsible for cybersecurity only.\nThis may include some members of Information Technology roles, depending on the organization size.\nThe limited size of the core CSIRT is to assist with confidentiality and efficiency.\nThe core CSIRT may be activated often to investigate security events that may or may not result in an incident.\nAssign roles and responsibilities to each member.\nDetermine extended CSIRT members.\nThis will often include Legal, Compliance, Public Relations, and Executive Leadership.\nDefine escalation paths.\nIncidents may start as events, or as a lower impact/severity and then increase as more information is gathered. Establishing an escalation path is critical to success.\nEvaluate and secure critical system backups.\nBackups should be secured prior to any incident.\nDuring the initial stages of any incident, evaluate and confirm that backups are secure and not impacted by the incident.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Isolate infected systems if it is technically feasible.\nDO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.\nPreserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.\nInvestigate malware to determine if it’s running under a user context.\nIf so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.\nAnalyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak.\nIf available, use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\nNote: Network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances. Network activity from malware may be used to alert an attacker of your investigation.\nObserve any attempts at network connectivity, note these as Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).\nObserve any files created or modified by the malware, note these as IoCs.\nNote where the malware was located on the infected system, note this as an IoC.\nPreserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password protected zip file.\nUse the PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s).\nThis hash may also be used to search for community information regarding this malware (i.e., VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, etc.)\nAdditional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.) may be gathered to better suit your security tools.\nNote these hash values as IoCs.\nUse all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nUse all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry.\nDetermine the first appearance of the malware.\nDetermine the user first impacted by the malware.\nInvestigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.\nAnalyze all possible vectors for infection.\nFocus on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).\nOnce the ransomware variant is identified, perform research to determine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with this variant and/or threat-actor.\nDetermine if data exfiltration and extortion is common.\nDetermine the attacker toolkit if possible.\n3. Containment: : Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps.\nExamples: Firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, user education, etc.\nOnce the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.\nAdd IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection.\nSet to block and alert upon detection.\nSubmit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection.\nNOTE: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.\nImplement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.\nIf additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.\n4. Eradication: : Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. These may be important for future forensics.\nIf rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives.\nIf rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nPreserve any volatile data that may have been collected during the identification and containment phases.\nThis may include log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.\nOnce all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available.\nFor systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nRemediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation.\nReset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nContinue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period.\nAlerts should be configured to aid in quick detection and response.\nIf data exfiltration and extortion were determined to be part of this attack, work with legal counsel to determine next steps.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss the following:\nWhat things went well during the investigation?\nWhat things did not go well during the investigation?\nWhat vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status were identified?\nHow will these be remediated?\nWhat further steps or actions would have been helpful in preventing the incident?\nReview and update security measures:\nNetwork segmentation\nFirewall configuration\nApplication security\nOperating System and/or Application patching procedures\nEmployee, IT, or CSIRT training\nCreate and distribute an incident report to relevant parties.\nA primary, and more technical, report should be completed for the CSIRT.\nAn executive summary should be completed and presented to the management team.\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",

Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Incident Response Playbook for social engineering incident by phone or e-mail\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\nRaise user awareness and security policies.\nNever give any personal or corporate information to an unidentified person. This could include user IDs, passwords, account information, name, e-mail address, phone (mobile or landline) numbers, address, social security number, job titles, information on clients, organization orIT systems. The goal of the social engineer is to steal human resources, corporate secrets or customer/user data. \nReport any suspicious event to your manager, who will forward it to the CISO in orderto have a centralized reporting. \nHave a defined process to redirect any “weird” request to a “red” phone, if needed. \nPrepare to handle conversation with social engineers to identify which information could help tracking the attacker and his goals. \nCheck your legal department to see which actions are allowed and which reactions they can handle.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\nPhone call / someone you don't know calls you/your service, asking for detailed information. \nIf the contact works out of the company and requests for information that could be valuable for a competitor, deny his requests and go to part 3.\nIf the contact pretends to be an employee of your company but the phone number is hidden or not internal, propose that you call back to the declared number in the directory. If the supposedly attacker agrees, call back to check. If he rejects this option, go to part 3.\nThe attacker might use several techniques to entice his victim to speak (fear, curiosity, empathy ...). Do not disclose information in any case. Listen carefully to his requests and at the end ask for a phone number to call back or an email address to reply. Take notes and stay calm, even if the attacker is shouting or threatening, remember he tries to use human weaknesses.\n\nIf you can go further, the following information will be precious: \nthe name of the correspondent \nrequested information / people \naccent, language skills \nindustry language and organizational knowledge \nbackground noises \ntime and duration of the call \nE-mail / Someone you don't know requests detailed information: \nIf the contact has an “out of the company” e-mail address and requests information that could be valuable for a competitor, go to part 3. \nIf the contact uses an internal e-mail address but is asking for weird information, ask him some explanations and use the company directory to get his manager's name that you'll place as a copy.\nEventually notify top management to inform them that an incident has been encountered relating to a social engineering attack. They might understand the goals depending on the context.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\nAt this step, you should be pretty sure that you're dealing with a social engineering attack. \n\nActions for all employees: \nPhone call \nIf the attacker urges you to give a phone number, follow these steps: \nUse the “red phone line” from your CERT/CSIRT, if existing. \nGive him the number with an invented name. \nImmediately call your CERT/CSIRT team explaining what happened and the chosen invented name. \nIf the attacker stresses you too much and does not let you time to find the Red Phone number, ask him to call you back later, pretending a meeting. If the attacker wants to reach someone, follow these points : \nPlace on hold the attacker and call CERT/CSIRT team and explain what happened. \nTransfer the conversation of the attacker to CERT/CSIRT team (do not give him the number). \n\nE-mail \nForward to your security team all email including headers (send as attached documents) for investigation purposes. It might help to track the attacker.\nActions for CERT or incidentresponse team: \n▪ Phone call Resume the conversation with the attacker and use one of these techniques: \nImpersonate the identity of the people whom the attacker is willing to speak \nSlow down and make last the conversation and entice the attacker to make mistake \nExplain him that social engineering attack is forbidden by law, punished by sanctions and that lawyer team will handle the issue if it continues \nIf the trap phone number has been used, prepare to “burn it”, create another one and display it in the directory. \n▪ E-mail \nCollect as much information as possible on the email address \nAnalyze the email headers and try to locate the source \nSearch the e-mail address with Internet tools \nGeolocalize the user behind the email address\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\nSome possible remediation actions can be tried: \nAlert the law enforcement and/or file a complaint \nDiscuss the problem in circles of trust to know if the company is facing this issue alone \nThreaten the attacker with legal actions if he can be identified \nReport email addresses used by the attacker to the provider abuse teams\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\nNotify the top management of the actions and the decisions taken on the social engineering case.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\nInform your hierarchy and subsidiaries about the incident, this could help to avoid similar attacks later. \nReport \nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the actors of the incident. \nThe following themes should be described: \nInitial cause of the infection \nActions and timelines of every important event \nWhat went right \nWhat went wrong \nIncident cost (direct and indirect losses) \nIndicators of compromise \n\nCapitalize \nActions to improve the social engineering handling processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience, especially awareness.\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",

Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : NIST compliant Incident Response Framework Playbook for Worm Infections\n1. Preparation\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\nDefine actors, for each entity, who will be involved into the crisis cell. These actors should be documented in a contact list kept permanently up to date. \nMake sure that analysis tools are up, functional (EDR, Antivirus, IDS, logs analyzers), not compromised, and up-to-date. \nMake sure to have architecture map of your networks. \nMake sure that an up-to-date inventory of the assets is available. \nPerform a continuous security watch and inform the people in charge of security about the threat trends.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 Detect the Infection:\nDetect the infection Information coming from several sources should be gathered and analyzed: \nAntivirus logs \nIDS/IPS \nEDR \nSuspicious connection attempts on servers \nHigh number of locked accounts \nSuspicious network traffic \nSuspicious connection attempts in firewalls \nHigh increase of support calls \nHigh load or system freeze \nHigh volumes of e-mail sent\nIf one or several of these symptoms have been spotted, the actors defined in the “preparation” step will get in touch and if necessary, create a crisis cell.\n2.2 Identify the infection \nAnalyze symptoms to identify the malware, its propagation vectors and countermeasures. \nLeads can be found from: \nCERT’s bulletins \nExternal support contacts (antivirus companies, etc.) \nSecurity websites \nThreat intelligence capabilities and providers\nNotify Chief Information Security Officer. Contact your national CERT and regulators if required.\nAssess the perimeter of the infection Define the boundaries of the infection. If possible, identify the business impact of the infection.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\nThe following actions should be performed and monitored by the crisis management cell: \n3.1 Disconnect the infected area from the Internet. \nIsolate the infected area. Disconnect it from any network. \nIf business-critical traffic cannot be disconnected, allow it after ensuring that it cannot be an infection vector or find validated circumventions techniques. \nNeutralize the propagation vectors. A propagation vector can be anything from network traffic to software flaw. Relevant countermeasures have to be applied (patch, traffic blocking, disable devices, etc.). \nFor example, the following tools/techniques can be used: \nEDR \nPatch deployment tools (WSUS) \nWindows GPO \nFirewall rules \nOperational procedures \n\nRepeat steps 2 to 4 on each sub-area of the infected area until the worm stops spreading. If possible, monitor the infection using analysis tools (antivirus console, server logs, support calls). \nThe spreading of the malware must be monitored.\n3.2 Mobile devices \nMake sure that no laptop, Smartphone or mobile storage can be used as a propagation vector by the malware. If possible, block all their connections. \nAsk end-users to follow directives precisely.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Identify \nIdentify tools and remediation methods. \nThe following resources should be considered: \nAntivirus signature database \nExternal support contacts \nSecurity websites \nYara scan, Loki, DFIR-ORC, ThorLite \nEDR search \nDefine a Disinfection Process. The process has to be validated by an external structure, i.e. CERT, SOC, Incident Response team. The most straight-forward way to get rid ofthe worm is to remaster the machine.\n4.2 Test \nTest the disinfection process and make sure that it properly works without damaging any service. \n4.3 Deploy \nDeploy the disinfection tools. Several options can be used: \nEDR \nWindows WSUS and GPO \nAntivirus signature deployment \nManual disinfection \nVulnerability patching\n\nWarning: some worm can block some of the remediation deployment methods. If so, a workaround must be found. Remediation progress should be monitored by the crisis cell.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\nVerify all previous steps have been done correctly and get a management approval before following next steps: \nReopen the network traffic that was used as a propagation method by the malware \nReconnect sub-areas together \nReconnect the mobile laptops to the area \nReconnect the area to your local network \nReconnect the area to the Internet \n\nAll these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and a technical monitoring shall be enforced by the crisis team.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Report \nA crisis report should be written and made available to all of the actors of the crisis management cell. \nThe following themes should be described: \nInitial cause of the infection \nActions and timelines of every important event \nWhat went right \nWhat went wrong \nIncident cost \nIndicators of compromise\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",

Detection and Analysis: : Isolate Infected Systems:\nIsolation Procedures: Isolate infected systems immediately to prevent the spread of malware. DO NOT power off machines, as forensic artifacts may be lost.\nPreservation: Preserve the system(s) for further forensic investigation, including log review, MFT analysis, deep malware scans, etc.\nInvestigate Malware Context:\nUser Context Investigation: Determine if the malware is running under a user context. If so, disable this account (or accounts if multiple are in use) until the investigation is complete.\nMalware Analysis:\nCharacteristics Analysis: Analyze the malware to determine characteristics that may be used to contain the outbreak. Use a sandboxed malware analysis system to perform this analysis.\nIoCs Collection: Observe any network connectivity attempts, files created or modified by the malware, and note the location of the malware on the infected system. Preserve a copy of the malware file(s) in a password-protected zip file. Use PowerShell “Get-FileHash” cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of the malware file(s) and gather additional hash values (SHA1, MD5, etc.).\nNetwork Connectivity: Note that network activity from malware may alert an attacker of your investigation; thus, network connectivity should not be present for this sandbox system except in very rare circumstances.\nUtilize IoCs:\nSearch Tools: Use all IoCs discovered to search any available tools in the environment to locate additional infected hosts.\nAssociated Attacks: Determine if the malware is associated with further attacks (e.g., Emotet, Trickbot, and Qakbot often involved in Ryuk ransomware attacks).\nInitial Point of Entry:\nIdentify Entry Point: Use all information and IoCs available to search for the initial point of entry. Determine the first appearance of the malware and the user first impacted by the malware. Investigate all available log files to determine the initial date and point of infection.\nAnalyze Vectors: Analyze all possible vectors for infection, focusing on known delivery methods discovered during malware analysis (email, PDF, website, packaged software, etc.).\n3. Containment: : Close Entry Points:\nGap Closure: Use the information about the initial point of entry gathered in the previous phase to close any possible gaps. Examples include firewall configuration changes, email blocking rules, and user education.\nIsolate Additional Infected Hosts:\nDevice Isolation: Once the IoCs discovered in the Identification phase have been used to find any additional hosts that may be infected, isolate these devices as well.\nUpdate Endpoint Protection:\nIoCs Addition: Add IoCs (such as hash value) to endpoint protection. Set to block and alert upon detection.\nCommunity Sources: Submit hash value to community sources to aid in future detection. Note: Clear this process with legal/compliance representatives during each incident, as each malware situation will be different.\nPrevent Escalation:\nApply Controls: If additional further attacks were noted as associated with the malware, use IoCs and threat-intel to apply additional controls to prevent the attack from escalating.\nImplement Network Rules:\nTemporary Rules: Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the malware.\nAccount Management: If additional accounts have been discovered to be involved or compromised, disable those accounts.\n4. Eradication: : Artifact Preservation:\nPreserve Artifacts: Preserve artifacts, systems, and relevant backups according to the sensitivity and scale of the incident. This may be important for future forensics. If rebuilding or replacing physical systems, preserve physical hard disks, solid-state drives, or forensically sound images of those storage drives. If rebuilding or replacing virtual machines, preserve a copy, full (independent) snapshot, or a backup of the system.\nVolatile Data: Preserve any volatile data collected during the identification and containment phases (log files, backups, malware samples, memory images, etc.).\nSystem Replacement:\nReplace Systems: Once all relevant data, equipment, and/or systems have been preserved, replace or rebuild systems accordingly.\n5. Recovery: : Restore Systems:\nClean Backup Restoration: Restore impacted systems from a clean backup, taken prior to infection if these backups are available. For systems not restorable from backup, rebuild the machines from a known good image or from bare metal.\nVulnerability Remediation:\nRemediate Vulnerabilities: Remediate any vulnerabilities and gaps identified during the investigation. This includes applying patches, closing unnecessary ports, and enhancing security configurations.\nAccount Management:\nReset Passwords: Reset passwords for all impacted accounts and/or create replacement accounts and leave the impacted accounts disabled permanently.\nOngoing Monitoring:\nExtended Monitoring: Continue to monitor for malicious activity related to this incident for an extended period. Configure alerts to aid in quick detection and response.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Post-Incident Review:\nMeeting: Conduct a meeting after the incident to discuss what went well and what did not. Identify vulnerabilities or gaps in the organization’s security status and determine how they will be remediated. Discuss further steps or actions that would have been helpful in preventing the incident.\nSecurity Measure Review:\nReview and Update: Review and update security measures such as network segmentation, firewall configuration, application security, OS and application patching procedures, and training programs for employees, IT, or CSIRT.\nIncident Report:\nReport Creation: Create and distribute an incident report to relevant parties. A primary, more technical report should be completed for the CSIRT.

Sure. Here is the information requested.\nTitle: : Ransomware Incident Response Playbook\n1. Preparation: : Objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an incident.\n1.1 A good knowledge of:\nThe usual operating systems security policies is needed.\nThe usual users’ profile policies is needed.\n1.2 Architecture, VLAN segmentation and interconnections:\nHave the capability to isolate entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\n1.3 Security Product Updates\nEnsure that the endpoint and perimeter (email gateway, proxy caches) security products are up to date.\n1.4 Deploy an EDR solution on endpoints and servers:\nThis tool became one of the cornerstones of the incident response in case of ransomware or in large-scale compromise, facilitating identification, containment, and remediation phases.\nLaunch EDR Search and AV scan with IOC explicit rules and get first indicators for remediation progress following.\nSet the EDR policies in prevent mode.\n1.5 IT Support Awareness\nSince this threat is often detected by end-users, raise the IT support awareness regarding the ransomware threat.\n1.6 Block IOCs\nBlock IOCs linked to ransomware activities gathered by Threat Intelligence.\n1.7 Deploy and operate security solutions enabling detection and facilitating response:\nLog gathering in a SIEM.\nHave the capacity to run tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC (ANSSI).\n1.8 Backups Preparation\nMake sure to have exhaustive, recent, and reliable backups of local and network users’ data.\nFollow the 3-2-1 backup rules:\nAt least three copies: three different copies in different places. By keeping them in different places, it reduces the risk of a single event destroying multiple copies.\nIn two different formats: this means that you must use at least two different methods to store the data. For example, DVD, Hard drive, Cloud services are different formats. But if you store two copies on two hard drives, you are just using one format.\nWith one of those copies offsite: Keeping one copy off-site ensures that even if whatever happens where the data is (fire, break-in, natural disaster) at least one copy is safe somewhere else. In this rule, cloud services make sense.\nTry to use one backup format stored out of the network: even if lateral movement happens from the threat that harms the network with encryption, one copy will be out of reach.\n1.9 Log Management\nHave good log retention and verbosity.\n1.10 Posture and Communication\nDefine a strict posture versus the attacker.\nPrepare internal and external communication strategy.\n1.11 Immediate Response\nIf a machine is identified with ransomware, unplug it from the network and keep it turned on for memory forensics investigation.\n2. Detection and Analysis: : Objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.\n2.1 General Signs of Ransomware Presence\nSeveral leads might hint that the system could be compromised by ransomware:\nMonitoring of ransomware IOCs by a SOC.\nSupervision of EDR alerts.\nOdd professional emails (often masquerading as invoices) containing attachments are being received.\nA ransom message explaining that the documents have been encrypted and asking for money is displayed on the user’s desktop.\nPeople are complaining about their files not being available or corrupted on their computers or their network shares with unusual extensions (.abc, .xyz, .aaa, etc.).\nNumerous files are being modified in a very short period of time on the network shares.\nPublication of information on the ransomware operator websites or forums.\nLateral movement is usually done; check all connections to the AD and ShareFile server with privileged accounts at abnormal times.\nLook for unusual network or web browsing activities; especially connections to Tor I2P IP, Tor gateways (tor2web, etc.), or Bitcoin payment websites.\nLook for rare connections.\n2.2 Scoping of the Incident\nEDR or large-scale hunting tools like YARA or DFIR-ORC allow the scoping of the ransomware-infected machines.\nThe identification of the initial access and the pivot used by the attackers is the priority, as in large-scale malware compromise. This allows establishing the following phase actions.\n2.3 Threat Actor Identification\nThe identification of the Threat Actor at the origin of the ransomware attack could help the following phases based on known TTPs.\nRansomware network compromise identification has many similarities with large-scale malware compromise. Most of the time, reaction decisions must be taken faster in ransomware cases. For more details about large-scale malware compromise, please refer to IRM-18.\n3. Containment: : Objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.\n3.1 Public Statement\nMake a public statement as soon as possible based on the communication template elaborated in the preparation phase.\n3.2 Follow Defined Posture\nFollow the posture defined in the preparation phase.\n3.3 Security Provider Actions\nSend the undetected samples to the endpoint security provider and/or private sandboxes.\nSend the uncategorized malicious URLs, domain names, and IPs to the perimeter security provider.\nBlock traffic to C2s.\nBlock any IP detected as used by attackers.\n3.4 Isolation\nIsolate compromised VLANs, interconnections, entities, regions, partners, or the Internet.\nDisable accounts compromised/created by attackers.\nDisconnect all computers that have been detected as compromised from the network.\nYou could isolate with EDR and shut down the internet while keeping EDR connections up.\nIf you cannot isolate computers, disconnect or cancel the shared drives.\n(NET USE x: \\unc\\path\\ /DELETE).\nMonitor ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet for any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n4. Eradication: : Objective: Take actions to remove the threat and avoid future incidents.\n4.1 Remove Threat\nRemove the initial access used by the attacker.\nRemove binaries used by the attacker to move laterally on the network.\nRemove any accounts created by attackers.\nRevert configuration changes.\nOperate systems and network configuration hardening.\n5. Recovery: : Objective: Restore the system to normal operations.\n5.1 Antivirus and Malicious Binaries\nUpdate antivirus signatures for identified malicious binaries to be blocked.\nEnsure that no malicious binaries are present on the systems before reconnecting them.\nEnsure that the network traffic is back to normal.\n5.2 Document Restoration\nRestore user’s documents from backups.\nPrioritize the recovery plan based on the DRP (disaster recovery plan).\nAll of these steps shall be made in a step-by-step manner and with technical monitoring.\n5.3 Backup Verification and System Reimaging\nVerify that backups are not compromised: only restore from a backup if you are very confident that the backup and the device you are connecting it to are clean.\nOR reimage the computer with a clean install.\n5.4 Credential Reset\nReset credentials including passwords (especially for administrator and other system accounts).\n5.5 Network Monitoring\nMonitor network traffic to identify if any infection remains.\nIf possible, apply geo-filtering on firewalls to block illegitimate foreign country traffic.\nMaintain the monitoring ransomware threat actor websites and the Internet to find if there is any data leak publication related to the ransomware compromise.\n6. Lessons Learned: : Objective: Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust plans and defenses.\n6.1 Report\nAn incident report should be written and made available to all the stakeholders. The following themes should be described:\nInitial cause of the infection.\nActions and timelines of every important event.\nWhat went right.\nWhat went wrong.\nIncident cost.\nIndicators of compromise.\n6.2 Capitalize\nActions to improve malware and network intrusion detection processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience.\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",

Detection and Analysis: : 2.1 Immediately take the defaced server offline for further investigation\nThis is especially important if the defacement is insulting or triggering in any way. Remove this from the public eye as quickly as possible to avoid harm as well as to mitigate business impact.\nThe defacement message may also contain false information that could mislead users or put them at risk.\nTaking the server offline will allow a deeper investigation of the defacement. This may be necessary as the hacker may have dove deeper into the organization accessing application servers, databases, etc.\n2.2 Determine the system's source of vulnerability that was used by the attacker. Common exploits include:\nSQL injection attacks\nThis kind of attack occurs when an attacker interferes with an application's queries to the database. Therefore, this can lead to unauthorized access to private or sensitive data.\nRemote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks\nThis kind of attack exploits an application's referencing function to upload malware from a remote URL.\nWebshells\nPoor web application design\nJavaScript hacks\nPHP/ASP hacks\nOther methods of detection include:\nChecking the server logs\nLook through the web page's access log and error log for any suspicious or unfamiliar activity\nIt is also a good idea to check the IDS or IPS firewall logs, if available\nChecking files with static content\nScanning databases for malicious content\nChecking links present in the page\n2.3 Collect any clues as to who the hacker is or what organization they are working for. Consider the following questions:\nWhat did the defacement portray? Did it include an obvious message?\nDid the defacement seem harmless or intentional? Could the hacker be a kid messing around or a professional group working with a motive?\nDoes it seem like your organization was targeted? Who may want to target your organization?\nWhat did the hacker hope to accomplish?\nConsult here to learn more about the types of hackers that may have attacked your webpage.\n2.4 Collect other important information from the page that has been defaced such as:\nA screenshot of the defacement\nThe domain and IP address of the page\nDetails of the web server\nPage's source code\nAnalyze this carefully to identify the problem and ensure that it is on a server belonging to the company\nName or any information on the attacker\n2.5 There are also tools available to aid in both detection and log analysis. A few are listed below:\nWeblog Expert\nSawmill\nDeep Log Analyzer\n3. Containment: : 3.1 Backup all data stored on the web server for forensic purposes.\n3.2 As previously mentioned, make sure to take the defaced page's server down temporarily while the investigation occurs.\nHave an error page prepared for this situation that informs user and/or employees that maintenance is underway and the page they sought will return shortly.\nhave a backup website prepared where you may publish content while investigation and remediation are underway and have your temporary error page redirect users to this backup site.\nCheck network architecture map. If the breach is another system on the network, take that down and investigate it.\n3.3 Once the source of the attack has been determined, apply the necessary steps to ensure this will not happen again. This may include modifying code or editing access rights.\nReference the \"Investigate\" section for common sources of vulnerability.\nIf this is outside of your domain, simply ensure that you have given the appropriate personnel all the information on the attack that you have and allow experts to do their job.\n4. Eradication: : 4.1 Remove the hacker's message and replace it with original, legitimate content. If data was lost in the attack, reference backups and restore the original page as much as possible.\nCheck backups for indicators of compromise\nConsider partial recovery and backup integrity testing\n4.2 Consider asking users to change their login credentials if the web server has user authentication.\n5. Recovery: : 5.1 After implementing risk avoidance measures (as recommended below), restore your server showing the original page content.\n5.2 If necessary and/or applicable, prepare an apology/explanation of the attack that occurred for users or anyone who witnessed the defacement. Ensure that it is clear that the defacement content does not reflect your organization in any way.\n6. Lessons Learned: : 6.1 Post-Incident Review\nConduct a thorough post-incident review to understand the root cause of the defacement.\nIdentify what worked well and what could be improved in the response process.\n6.2 Documentation and Reporting\nDocument all findings, actions taken, and outcomes of the incident.\nPrepare a detailed report for stakeholders and leadership, highlighting lessons learned and areas for improvement.\n6.3 Update Incident Response Plan\nRevise the incident response plan based on lessons learned.\nIncorporate new procedures, tools, and best practices identified during the incident response.\n6.4 Share Knowledge\nShare lessons learned with relevant teams and stakeholders to improve overall organizational security posture.\nConduct training sessions or workshops to disseminate findings and recommendations.\n6.5 Continuous Improvement\nEstablish a process for continuous improvement of incident response capabilities.\nRegularly review and update security policies, procedures, and technologies to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n\n\n\n**Category**: Incident Response Playbook\n**Source**: SOAR Elite Dataset\n",
